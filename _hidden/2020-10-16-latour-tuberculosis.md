title: Existing and Nonexisting Objects Bruno Latour

[Chapter 10 of some textbook](https://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/jbell/partialexistence.pdf)

Somehow I stumbled across a quote by French Philosopher Bruno Latour about the "invention" of tuberculosis: 

> After careful examination, the verdict of the postmortem ("post" indeed!) is offered: Ramses II had very bad teeth, a terrible deformation of the spinal cord that caused extreme pain. Too late for an intervention. But not too late to claim still another triumph for French physicians and surgeons, whose reach has now expanded in remote time as well as in remote space. The great advantage of this picture is that it renders visible, tangible, and material the expense at which it is possible for us to think of the extension in space of Koch's bacillus, discovered (or invented, or made up, or socially constructed) in 1882. Let us accept the diagnosis of" our brave scientists" at face value and take it as a proved fact that Ramses died of tuberculosis. How could he have died of a bacillus discovered in 1882 and of a disease whose etiology, in its modern form, dates only from 1819 in Laennec's ward? Is it not anachronistic? The attribution of tuberculosis and Koch's bacillus to Ramses II should strike us as an anachronism of the same caliber as if we had diagnosed his death as having been caused by a Marxist upheaval, or a machine gun, or a Wall Street crash. Is it not an extreme case of "whiggish" history, transplanting into the past the hidden or potential existence of the future? Surely, if we want to respect actors' categories, there must be
in the Egyptian language a term and a set of hieroglyphs, for instance "Saodowaoth," that define the cause of Ramses' death. But if it exists it is so
incommensurable with our own interpretations that no translation could
possibly replace it by "an infection of Koch's bacillus." Koch bacilli have a
localhistory that limits them to Berlin at the turn of the century. They may
be allowed to spread to all the years that come after 1882 provided Koch's
claim is accepted as a fact and incorporated later into routine practices, but
certainly they cannot jump back to the years before

I tracked down the full essay to read which is linked above. Latour is a very entertaining writer, but he never turns the above thesis around into something coherent. There's no clever twist. 

Either:
- Latour is a monumentally genius troll. or
- The guy genuinely doesn't understand the difference between words and objects.


Our distant ancestors didn't have a word which perfectly translates to "fire". Go back far enough and our ancestors didn't have words at all. Yet we can still meaningfully say that they may have burned themselves while cooking. <!--The word "love" presents difficulties in translation not just between languages-->

The essay goes on to describe the history of Germ Theory displacing the theory of Spontaneous Generation. Why, Latour asks, do we now say that Spontaneous Generation was *never* true? After Napolean's defeat, we didn't start insisting that his empire never existed. What follows is several pages of Latour failing to demonstrate an understanding between the beliefs in a phenomenon, the institutions which allow those beliefs to thrive, and the phenonomenon itself. <!--He goes on to tout the conflation between nature and context as a benefit of this frame of thought.-->

I'm not sure how you could even respond to such a person. Words may not work because they've spent a good long effort making themself forget what words even are. Perhaps the best remedy would be to sit down with Latour and watch Bruce Lee's *Enter the Dragon*

<!--I like to image handing him an old flint knife, and telling him... something something ancestors living expereiecns, importance of qualia, etc.-->

(And in fact, Latour is correct that physical phenomena are not ahistoric. Fermentation did at some point come into being. It's just that this point was not the same point at which the word "fermentation" came into being. Just as Jupiter's moons did not come into existence the moment Galileo peered through his telescope.)

<!--(Also, Latour seems to have seen the light in later years, expressing dismay about how his style of critiques has been used. "The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naÃ¯ve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution.")-->
