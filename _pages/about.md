This repo is for collecting all of my reading notes in a centralized place.
This isn't the typical use-case for a blog template, 
and these posts aren't really meant to be perused through and read by other people, 
though I might share a post with someone.
If you've found yourself here that way, please don't judge me too harshly for the messiness of this site.


The advantages of using a blog template are that I can search through posts, and organize things by tag.
Also, because it's hosted on github pages, I can very easily access and even edit these notes from any platform or device. 

I was inspired to set things up this way after reading about the initial impetus behind the internet is to make hardware irrelevant when it came to sharing data among CERN researchers. 
Well, I'm trying to make hardware relevant for my own notes as well. 
(And file hosting is too bulky and won't render markdown with latex, of course.)

This repo is for absolutely any informative media I consume.
The Category label is used to split things up by the medium:

- **talk** for seminars, job market talks and the like, which aren't part of a recurring workshop
- **class** for any meetings I attend repeatedly. Nowadays, that will simply be workshops.
- **youtube** for any videos I watch online, including recordings of talks that I didn't actually "attend"
- **journal** for working papers and published research articles
- **textbook** for longform published reference material
- **online** for things like blogposts, wiki articles, and news stories
