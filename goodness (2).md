## What makes a paper good?

To fill in later after doing some reading and thinking




### Learning to write a paper and subsequently talk about it.

Rahman's advice is that on the margin I need to focus on *writing* a paper and let the thinking happen as a byproduct.

My problem is that I don't know *how* to write a paper. 
Advice: mimic the style of good papers.

Where are the good papers?

* Top journals:
  * AER
  * Econometrica
    * Latest issue has an author with no experience in matching literature writes a paper on complementary contracts. She reads a bunch, wanders in, dislocates a subject
* Punchy Authors:
  * Aumann
  * Faruk Gul
  * Lucas on dynamic programming?
  
<!--I've head about the benefits of guys like Lucas have broad intersets and take something from another field and turn it into a revolutionary econ insight)-->
<!--but for me my interests are too disfocused to hone in on one particular thing. Is problem.-->




### Advice from Rahman after listening to my horrible talk on Sept 22.

Rahman was frustrated by my talk today. 
I spent too long on obvious stuff, which suggests that I lack confidence in my material.
  (Though this contradicts the advice from the previous night about thinking of it like a lecture for undergrads and to "present more details than you like".
     (Unless the main takeaway is that my undergrad lecture style also needs complete rethinking.))
  (Well if I state more details but pump them out smoothly, that's probably more listenable.)
I need to state proofs upfront; my discourse should be more formal. 
Study problem. Deliver Analysis. 
(Note to self. Concrete equations and theorems *before* extemporaneously rambling about them)

(Was the previous time I explained with a list of obvious theorems listed out boom boom boom a better style?)

He also got the vibe that I didn't really care about what I was presenting. Not sure why I gave off that vibe. Maybe it was the disheveledness of it?

I need to condense the talk and deliver more man-hours of work in that hour. 
Some people spend two years of work and condense it into an hour of talk. 
How many hours of Robbie work did I show off? Not much, he says. 
(I spend lots of time making it but it was so disorganized that I only showed off a piece of it.)


Paper should go:
* Conjecture
  * Proof
  * (Examples)
* Repeat

And then once that's banged out, go back and reorganize it.

> I want to see a paper, not a TED talk. I hate TED talks.

Comparison to *Being John Malkovich*. That's a movie with no fat to trim. One scene happens then another then another.
  (A comparison I recalled was the [Catch Me if You Can guy giving a talk at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsMydMDi3rI).
  No stuttering. No pausing. He makes a point and smoothly keeps moving. Story story story story... No improvization.)
Filmmakers watch films and try to imitate that style.
If I'm not sure what a good paper looks like, I should read some good papers and try to imitate the style.
Fake it till you make it.

Also lots of advice about making it a top priority and spending time on it. Thinking about problems as I fall asleep.
But I'm already doing that! The problem is that my time is misallocated. 
And I do waste lots of time. But in terms of spending effort on spending more effort, I think I'm up against the boundary conditions.
I already have pills and psychiatry appoints and special lighting equipment.
What I need is to expend that time and effort productively.


My problem is that I don't know *how* to write a paper. 
Took a second year class where the advice was to write a bad paper to get it out of your system. But didn't really heed that advice.
So I wasted a good chunk of time. 
First year and half of second year were disrupted by illness. Third year was largely misallocated and that's my fault.




### Short-term goals

* Read one paper from Aumann and one from Gul
  * Make notes about what makes them good
* Write out a list of three specific conjectures/theorems I can make about tranmissions. State and prove these statements by thursday.
* Friday, September 25th by 4pm: Submit a paper.
* (anti-goal: don't allocate time to other shiny doodads)
  * don't spend more time on making marginal improvements to your lecturing
  * Don't spend more time in the short run on art projects
  * don't spend time making pretty macro notes for the first years.
  * Don't spend time going through computational exercises (until next week when Fatih's workshop makes them important.)
