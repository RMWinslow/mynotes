[How to Write a Great Research Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-FkUaOcOM)

> Writing papers and giving talks are key skills for any researcher, but they aren’t easy. In this pair of presentations, I’ll describe simple guidelines that I follow for writing papers and giving talks, which I think may be useful to you too. I don’t have all the answers—far from it—and I hope that the presentation will evolve into a discussion in which you share your own insights, rather than a lecture.

## Don't wait! Write!

Instead of sitting down and going `Idea` -> `Do Research` -> `Write Paper`, you should do `Idea` -> `Write Paper` -> `Do Research`.
This crystallizes your focus and enables you to talk to other people about it.
Like a forcing function that forces you to figure out what's important about the work.

Writing papers isn't just reporting about the research you've done. It's the way of *doing* research.

## Goal of writing a paper

A good paper is a virus. You want to get the idea out of your head and move it into other people's heads.

Your paper should have a "ping": One clear sharp idea.
If you have lots of ideas, then write lots of papers.
The limiting factors are the good ideas you have and *how fast you can write them down*.

Some papers have good ideas, but don't distill those ideas. Make sure there is no doubt in the reader's mind about what the ideea is.

> "The main idea of the paper is..."

> "In this section we present the main contributions of the paper."

### Don't be intimidated.

You don't need a _fantastic_ idea to write a paper. 
Write a paper and give a talk about __any idea__
no matter how weedy and insignificant it may seem to you
Writing the paper is how you clarify the idea.




# What do you put in the paper?

Like telling a good story:

- Here is a problem
- It's an interesting problem
- It's an unsolved problem
- *Here is my idea*
- My idea works (details, data, etc.)
- Here's how my idea compares to other people's approaches.

(also maybe this advice can be applied to lectures.)

Readership  sharply falls off after the Title, abstract and introduction.

## abstract

## introduction:

1. Describe the problem.
2. State your contributions

... and that is all. One page (of an 14 style two column format)

Don't overstate. 
Honestly describe the molehills instead of the mountains.
