A Theory of Disappointment Aversion   
By Faruk Gul  
Econometrica 1991

# First Page

The purpose of the paper is to develop an axiomatic model of decision making under uncertainty that

- Includes expected utility as a special case
- is consistent with the [Allais Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox#Statement_of_the_problem)
- is the most restrictive possible model that satisfies both of the above.

Brief description of structure and restatment of goal

Set up preferences to be one parameter richer than vNM preferences. When this parameter $\beta$ is zero, the we get  vNM expected utility. With $\beta$ positive, the agent is strictly "dissapointment averse".

Risk aversion implies disspointment aversion.

The intro barely spills over on the second page. Could fit on the first without the attributionary footnotes. Very concise.
