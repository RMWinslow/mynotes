> **One Sentence Summary:** Models that curtail individual variation in susceptibility or exposure
to infection overestimate epidemic sizes and herd immunity thresholds.

> Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-
CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that 
allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in
susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates


Basic idea is that the people most likely to get sick are then most likely to become immune from that sickness.
Thus the natural spread of disease, unlike random vaccination, has a built in selection mechanism to target the individuals who need it most (in the societal sense of "need")

> We integrate
continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in otherwise basic epidemic models for
COVID-19 and show that as the coefficient of variation (CV) increases from 0 to 4, the herd
immunity threshold declines from over 60% (4, 5) to less than 10%. 

coefficient of variation is the ratio of standard deviation $\sigma$ to absolute mean $| \mu |$
