    - Holmes 2011, Oberfeld 2020
- Firm geography and Market concentration
    - Ross-hamnsberg 2020: concetration increasing at national level (walmart getting big) but decreasing at local level (walmart competing with small locals)

Utilities most striking. Number of establishments going up, but size of each establishment going down.



6 million firms with at least 1 employee.
4 and a half million? have only 1 employee.


f: 350/1000 top firms in manufacturing. Now 150. Were 150-200/1000 in retail. Now 400.

f: Read papers, thing about what the key issues are, and come up with interesting stories explaining what happens that differ from what others say. 
If you can link that question to the broad question, people will read your abstract.
A lot of the time, grad students want to answer a new question. If you link it to rising concentraion, you don't have to convince people of the importance of the problem. Just the quality of your story.

f: Something happend at the turn of the mellinium. A lot changed in 1973 as well. Can't pinpoint exactly what it is. Oil, energy, computers, etc.

f: costofliving gap growing. so firms in major metro area will have higher wage and thus higher labor share.
