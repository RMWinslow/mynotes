Twinkies anecdote
: Twinky going bankrupt. Tries to negotiate with union. Union says no. Twinky fails.

Euro stock markets very small. Maybe because if company goes under, courts will favor workers more. 

"If I'm lending to GM, I'd think twice".

Why such an increase in outsourcing? Maybe because it makes you more nimble. When a recession comes, you don't have to fire workers. You can just stop buying services.
Look at Circuit City. They had long-term leases that they couldn't get out of.

During recession, GM offered buyouts. 100k to leave. Can't fire them, because of unions.

Adjustment cost models of capital and labor.

Paper idea: labor market policies make it harder for firms to fire. Quantify friction on overall economy. Misallocation. Firm won't be able to borrow because workforce unionizes. Service firms employ more workers, so maybe a labor fircition will hit service sector more.

Leverage effect? in finance literature.


The most important thing for a graduate student to have done
: The audience will care a lot more about if you understand your model than about your quantitative conclusions. What channel are the results coming from? If you tweak this parameter, what happens to this other parameter?

Modelling collatoral constraint: One way is that manager can run away with funds.

Start simple. Don't add anything unless you are absolutely sure you will need it.



If a stock ticker has a Q at the end, it means the firm no longer exists.

Private firms have majority of capital stock and value added.

Collatoral constraints are shortcut. Nobody looks at capital you have and gives you X times that. Can micro-found based on interest rates



TODO: Read paper called "good jobs and bad jobs".
About difference between firms that invest in hiring process and have long-term employess.
CAuses difficulty using vacancy to estimate employment stock.
