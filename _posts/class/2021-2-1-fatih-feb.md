## Questions from last week:

### Offshore profits

Companies hold cash reserves. Money is fungible. 
Microsoft for example issued huge divideds. Like 20k per share.
There was a quarter in the US where consumption growth was equal to Microsoft's dividend payments.
Huge amount of stock buyback.

American companies and residents have to pay us taxes wherever they live.
The way you avoid US taxation is through "perpetual reinvestment" abroad.
IRS might show up and check whether you have actually reinvested.
So these companies actually started building factories in Bermuda and Ireland.
Apple used to have 50 employees in Ireland, now they have thousands.
This distorts investment activity.

Microsoft buys Skype for loads of money.
Skype is based in Luxemburg. 
so if they had brought that that cash to us, would lose 35%.
So that 8.5 billion was really only 5 billion.
Low employment to population ratio.

After 2018, feeling is it went to stock buybacks

C-corp 35% corp income tax

TODO: 
Hasn't been analyzed as much as it should be.
"Offshore profit shifting". Fatih.
Still dozens of papers to be written.
Fixed cost of avoidance.
Jovanavich 82.
Abroad domestic, fixed cost of avoiding.

### Labor flows and outsourcing

Macro looks at things differently than micro labor

Fatih present presntation about wage inequality.
Prescott warned him not to use the term "wage inequality".
"wage dispersion, etc."
Sometimes we give a name to a statistic, but that's just a number.
Giving it a name makes it seem good or bad.
Be careful before labelling something with an objective.

Business Dynamism.
Catchy name, but implies that decreas in labor flows and income volatility are bad.
And it propbably is bad.
But none of these papers actually prove its bad.
Increasing volatility: "economic uncertainty".
Decreasing volatility: "reduction in firm dynamism"

If you look at firm entry rate, declining in last 35 years.
But firm exit is also declining.

How do I know that what's declining is mom and pop shops?
It's because that's like 99% of firms.
Google are 1 in a billion kinda firms.
Show me there is a decline in the star industries (4 digit SIC code level), not just dry cleaners.

Example research: went to each 4 digit sic code, built an index of quality of entry.
A company that enters big does well.
Median firm enters with 6. A firm that enters with 50 does well.
A firm that enters with lots of capital does well.
The companies that have big effects are still entering at same rate.

Going back to question, lesson is that macro perspective can miss important details.
Some guy at the BLS has data about janitors, secretaries, security, etc.

Value-added of manufacturing has been rising.
One explanation is productivity growth.
Another explanation is they have the same number of janitors, they just don't employ them.

Not very many papers about ousourcing and the like.

Todo: maybe ask if he has data about hospitals. Employment of non-medical staff, etc.?

QJE: Boston Univ schidler.
best paper that looks at this.
