## Business cycle inefficiency without price rigidities.

Clasic model give positive output gap when hit with a negative TFP shock.
If pandemic supply shock, why stimulus?

Alternative model
- Decrease in agg demand increases price markups endogenously
- negative TFP shock creates negative output gap
- still has Keynesian cross idea of expenditure production feedback mechanism



Cris: Are markups acyclical? What's the evidence?

Rene: Think markups are procyclical.

Model has countercyclical markups.

Overusing CES framework.

Negative genral income shock shifts weighting from high elast to low elast customer

Given lower pirce elast, the firm increase the markups over marginal cost.



Fatih mentions model where non homotheticity is important.








Cris: live or die with cyclicality of markups.
