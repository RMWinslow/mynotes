He's trying to build a model to explain why unionization is decreasing in the US and elsewhere.

His story is that increasing gaps in skill difference between high and low skilled workers is giving high skilled workers a better outside option.

Then the union can collapse via an evaporative cooling kinda oricess, Insurance style.

His model doesn't have unions provign insurance. Rather, the unino is compressing wages

Here's what comes to my mind:
Computers vs Electricity.

- If you're an electrical worker and don't join [IBEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Electrical_Workers), then the union won't let you work for the power distribution company. So what's your outside option? Working as an independent electrician? Most peopole won't go for that. You'll probably work at the uion company even if you are the best lineman in the entire state.
- If you are a computer worker, you have the option to go to work at a startup. The average income of a startup worker will be lower than the average income of a union company worker. But the most skilled computer programmers can work at a startup that gets purchased for billions of dollars. Microsoft buying Mojang, Walmart buying [jet.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet.com)
