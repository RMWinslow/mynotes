Notes from the wikipedia article on [Branching Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process)
And from the supplementary notes from [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04153).

## From the linked paper, 

We have a probability generating function $g$ of  the offspring distribution $Z$
$$g(s)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty Pr(Z=j) s^j$$

When $R_0 > 1$, prob of disease extinction after we introduce one infection $q\in(0,1)$ is the unique solution to $q=g(q)$

If $Z$ is a negative binomial distribution $Z \sim NegB(R_0, k)$, then
