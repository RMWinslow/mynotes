- growing wage gap based on education
- less common for low and high skill workers to work in same firm
- model low and high as imperfect substitutes
- When mean and variance of skill increase, firms have to specialize in one over the other.

## Simple model of worker pairs

Consider firm which needs two tasks done, and hires workers with skills $q$ (assistant) and $q'$ (manager) to do each.

$$f(q,q')=q^c+q'^d \equiv qq'^2$$

*(f:This is the most important piece of the model. Simple idea that does a lot of work.
Problem with CES literature is that changes are made at top level without looking at micro foundations.)*

Better to assign high skill employee to manager position.

- one-good economy
- exogenous distribution of workers of different skills
- indefinite supply of firms, same production funciton
- dispersion of skill distribution decreases dispersion of skill between manager and assisstant.
    - Example: two people with skill L, two with H
    - Should the be matched by skill or should low-skill be paired with high
    - cross-matching makes sense if $$L^3 + H^3 < 2LH^2$$, which happens if $$H < (1+\sqrt{5})L/2$$
- Two competing effects:
    - Assymetry between tasks promotes cross-matching (high skilled all managers), 
    - but complementarity promotes assortive matching 

### Example with wages
- three skill levels: $L < M < H$
- population $x$ with skill $L$, $x$ with skill $H$, more than $2x$ with skill $M$.
- $H < (1+\sqrt{5})L/2$, so no self-match for $H$ or $L$ types
- Both H and L types should be matched with M types because $LH^2 + M^3 < LM^2 + MH^2$
- There will be some M types left over.
- Assume workers absorb all revenue. Then:
    - M-types in M,M firms earn $w(M) = M^3 / 2$
    - Other M types earn the same
    - L types in L,M firms earn $w(L)=LM^2-w(M)=LM^2-M^3/2$
    - H types in H,M firms earn $w(L)=MH^2-w(M)=MH^2-M^3/2$
- what happens when M skill increases?  
    $$\frac{d}{dM}w(L) = 2LM - \frac{3}{2}M^2$$  
    $$\frac{d}{dM}w(H) = H^2 - \frac{3}{2}M^2$$

- If low dispersion $L\approx H$, then a marginal increase in M causes $w(L)$ to rise and $w(H)$ to fall. Wages converge.
- If high dispersion where $$L < \frac{3}{4}M < \frac{\sqrt 6}{4}H$$, opposite effect. wages diverge.
- Intutition:
    - If L close to M, 
        - Increase in M's share decreases more slowly than total product.
        - "trickle-down" effect, where improving productivity of high-paid workers accrues benefits to low-paid
        - *I think this is the only time I've actually seen that term used by an economist.*
    - If L and M far apart
        - product of LM firms rises more slowly than MM firms, so wages of M increase, and wages of L fall.
        - At the same time, boosts wage of H for similar reasons.


## segregation index

- $J$ firms indexed by $j$
- $z_j$ workers in firm $j$
    - $Z_j$ denotes the set of these
- Denote mean skill level $\bar q$
- Define index of correlation or segregation $\rho$:

$$\rho \equiv 
\frac{\sum_j\sum_{k\in Z_j} (q_k-\bar q) \sum_{k\in Z_j} (q_k-\bar q)/z_j }
{\sum_j\sum_{k\in Z_j} (q_k-\bar q)^2}$$

- $\rho=0$ indicates all firms have same skill mix. 
- $\rho=1$ indicates complete segregation, in which workers within each firm have no variation.
- Equivalent to 
    - one minus the variance within firms divided by overall variance
    - regressing $q$ on firm dummies and looking at $R^2$
- With finite firms, $\rho > 0$ expected due to random chance. 
    - Even with random employee assignment, some firms will just get lucky.
    - If all firms had $K$ workers, randomly chosen from pool, expectation is that $\rho = 1/K$
- index adjusted for firm size

$$\rho_c = 1 - (1-\rho)\frac{N-1}{N-J}$$


## measuring segregation

- Want to measure at plant level
    - obfuscated by outsourcing
    - French data more similar to firm level
- France Wage Structure Surveys (ESS)
    - correlation of low wages and experience rose within business units
    - segregation by worker category rose.
- Similar evidence from US and BRitish worker surveys 
- segregation indices by US state
    - Kremer Trosker 1995
    - Worker-Establishment Characteristics Database (WECD)
    - states with more education variance have more segregation by education
    - Prediction doesn't work for varaince/segregation by age
    - when using log wage or predicted wage as skill indicator, prediction correct but not statistically significant.






## Generalized model

- two distributions - pre and post shift - on worker skill level $n\in\mathbb Z$
    - support bounded by $\underline n, \bar n$
- parameter $\theta=0$ representing pre-shift in distributions, $\theta=1$ post-shift
- $\mu(\theta)$ for means
    - assume equal to $n^*(\theta)$ modes
- Recall $A=2/(1+\sqrt 5)$ to be cutoff ratio that makes assortive better than cross-matching
- $$
- Some additional assumptions to ensure some modal workers will self-match
    - makes computation of equilibrium wages easier.
- Some additional assumptions to ensure there is a range of workers who will match with modal workers.
- shift in distributions reflects stylized facts
    - mean skill rises
        - n^*(1)=n^*(0)+1
    - dispersion increases
        - tails get symetrically fatter but retain relative shapes
        - $p(n;1)/p(n;0)=\alpha$ for all n outside some central range.



### Propositions

#### Prop1 (trickle down)
With tight bounds on the distribution of skill, a shift of the kind described decreases wage dispersion.
If $\underline n > \sqrt{2/3} \bar n$, then 
- $w(n;0) < w(n;1)$ for all $n < n^*(0)$
- $w(n;0) > w(n;1)$ for all $n > n^*(1)$


#### Prop2

Given large enough bounds in the story above, the wage in the low tail decreases, and wage in high tail increases

#### segregation
Increase in skill dispersion increases segragation index, provided shift in mean is small relative to shift in dispersion

# Related: Firming Up Inequality

Prof Guvenen's presentation

1. 70-100% of of rise in inequality is between firms.
2. between-firm only 50-60% for 
    - Mage firms (10k+ employees)
    - Top 0.5% earning (above 0.5 million)
3. What explains?
    - half segregation, half sorting
    - firm pay differences contribute very little
    - so really a story about worker skill dispersion.

At high end, gap between productivity growth and earnings growth. Isn't seen at the low end?

Trend seems to be global.

For firms 20-10000 employees (most firms), increase in variance almost entirely between firm. Only in large firms do we see increase within firms.
For sub-1000k employees, basically 100% between-firm.

Within-firm CEO pay up 10% proportionally.
Typical news story compares median pay of Fortune 500 CEO to median of all workers.

Bottom fell out in the large firms.

Stock options count as income in new dataset.

<!--Silly analogy: It's true that height has increased over time. And it's true that there's a sex-based height gap. But comparing growth in NBA player height to average woman's height would exagerate this effect.-->

Silly simple example:
- 



At top, worker pay directly connected to stock price. High level workers more like shareholders. Connection decreases as you go down the worker pay ranking.

49 industry classification.




Is it between occupation within a firm, or across occupation. EG does google hire the best janitor in the country, or do they outsource janitors?
Suggestive: occupational composition shrank over time.


Segregation happening in many dimensions in society. Education differences between school districts.
Kansas city. Stereotype of KS side as nursery.
Landslide counties increasing.

*Tangential related thoughts*

To what extent does a private school paying teachers lower the quality of public schools.


High skill dispersion makes it difficult to sustain unions. (TODO)

TODO: read Shirwen Rosen's papers. 
Simple models are good at capturing ideas.

- KS stereotypes
- interesting that political polarization is maybe just an instance of general societal polarization
- Kremer likes his two-type dispersion models
- In Kremer model, seems between-firm segregation happens because you hire really high quality janitors.
- prefential mixing in Newman model
