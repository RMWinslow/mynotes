From [^anderson], in a simple random mixing model, 

$$R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\delta} \left(  \mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}  \right)$$

$$R_0 = \frac{birthRate}{deathRate} \left(  meanPartnerChange + \frac{variancePartnerChange}{meanPartnerChange}  \right)$$

[^anderson]: Anderson, R. M., & May, R. M. (1992). **Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control.** *Oxford university press*.

With $N$ discrete groups of people, each representing $\alpha_k$ portion of the population and with $i_k$ partners per year:

$$R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\delta} \frac{\sum \alpha_k i_k^2}{\sum \alpha_k i_k}$$

deriv wrt $i_j$

$$R_{0}^{\prime}=\frac{\beta}{\delta}\cdot\frac{2\alpha_{j}i_{j}\sum\alpha_{k}i_{k}-\alpha_{j}\sum\alpha_{k}i_{k}^{2}}{\left(\sum\alpha_{k}i_{k}\right)^{2}}$$

If enough variance, and low enough $i_j$, this can actually be negative, meaning increased partners decreases $R_0$.

Compare the two formulas for $R_0$ and you get that
$$i < \frac{1}{2}  (\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu})$$


But authors say result isn't robust, so don't try applying this to actual policy.

## Model

- N groups of people, indexed by k. 
    - Have $i_k$ sex partners per year.
    - Make up portion $\alpha_k$ of population
    - $y_k$ portion of group $k$ has HIV
- mean sexual activity is thus 

$$\mu = \sum_k \alpha_k i_k$$

- variance is 

$$\sigma^2 = \sum_k \alpha_k (i_k - \mu)^2$$

- pool-risk (activity weighed prevalence)

$$\lambda = \sum_k \frac{\alpha_k i_k y_k}{\mu}$$

- People select partners randomly, but with preference for their own type
    - $1-\gamma$ chance of completely random seleciton
    - $\gamma$ chance of random selection from their group
- New births happen to keep relative sizes of groups consant
- probablity of transmission when infected sexes uninfected is $\beta$
- Thus an uninfected individual becomes infected at rate:
    - $$\gamma \beta i_k y_k \cdot (1-y_k)$$ from their own group
    - $$(1-\gamma) \beta i_k \gamma \cdot (1-y_k)$$ from the general population
- dynamics of illenss in group k:

$$\dot y_k = -\delta y_k + \gamma \beta i_k y_k \cdot (1-y_k) + (1-\gamma) \beta i_k \gamma \cdot (1-y_k)$$

$$\theta = \frac{\beta}{\delta}$$

From Jacquez [13], either the disease becomes endemic and stable or dies out. Threshold function (where $G < 1$ means dies out) is 

$$G(\gamma,\frac{\beta}{\delta}, \{i_k\}, \{\alpha_k\},) = \frac{\beta}{\delta} (1-\gamma) (\mu+\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}) + \frac{\beta}{\delta} \gamma \max_k \{i_k\}$$

Thus if $G > 1$, steady state given by solving

$$Y_k = \frac{\beta}{\delta} i_k (1-Y_k)(\gamma Y_k +(1-\gamma) \Lambda)$$

where 

$$\Lambda = \sum_k \frac{\alpha_k i_k Y_k}{\mu}$$

is the steady state pool risk.


If no preference for sex with their own group, ($\gamma = 0$) simplifies to 

$$Y_k = \frac{\frac{\beta}{\delta} i_k \Lambda}{1 + \frac{\beta}{\delta} i_k \Lambda}$$

---

## effect of change in $ i_k$

If someone with partners fewer than $\Lambda$ increases activity
- In short run, lowers $\lambda$, because hookups are less risky
- In long run, may or may not lower $\Lambda$


Define $j_t$ to be cut off for activity level below which increase in activity leads to reduction in long-term prevalence.

Define $j_e$ to be cut off so that increase in activity decreases steady-state pool-risk. (POsitive externailty creators). Always positive.

Some technical lemmas.

If group has activity less than $j_e$ partners per year, increase in activity will reduce $\Lambda$ at the margins where

$$j_e = \frac{\delta}{\beta(\gamma+(1-\gamma)\Lambda)^2}\left( \gamma-(1-\gamma)\Lambda + \sqrt{\frac{1-\gamma}{1-\Lambda}} (\Lambda - (1-\Lambda)\gamma) \right)$$

and 

$$0 < j_e < \frac{\delta}{\beta(1-\Lambda)}$$


More technical proofs

### special case: random mizing

$$j_e = \frac{\delta}{\beta(\Lambda)^2}\left( -\Lambda + \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-\Lambda}} (\Lambda) \right)$$

$$j_e = \frac{\delta}{\beta\Lambda}\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{1-\Lambda}} - 1 \right)$$

$$Y_e = 1-\sqrt{1-\Lambda}$$

Then some simulations and implications


## conclusions

perferes mixing single sex model

Best matches situtation where sex seekers always have a partner. If dating low activity people takes time then reduction by low activity would reduce activity from high activity groups and thus change implications.
