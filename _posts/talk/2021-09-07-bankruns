Diamond-Dybvig shows solvent banks vulnerable to self fulfilling runs,

This paper tries to put them into general equilibrium model.


## Model
- Default is a strategic decisions. Limited commitment.
- Default causes:
    - a lower productivity for the bank
    - permanent financial exclusion $b' = 0$
- Banks can choose mixed strategies.
    - equilibrium might not exist (no fixed point) if return on capital $R^k$ too high.
    - When there are two fixed points, the larger one violates No-Ponzi, while the smaller is unstable.
    - So banks are allowed to randomize their decisions whne they are indifferent. (This makes the equiilbrium more tractable.)
    - Also means that fraction $\phi$ can defaults and $1-\phi$ repay. (differnt from Kehoe-Levine)
- Borrowing contract adjusts in such a way that all the action happens at time period 0.
- Should the government intervene to ease credit? Depends on whether bank runs are because of bad fundamentals or self-fulfilling prophecies.
