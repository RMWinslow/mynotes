Multiple Hands, Multiple Voices
: Ask a question, tell students won't call on someone until at least 5 hands are raised. (*Maybe roll a dice*)



Give one:
- Many students feel more comfortable asking questions in the text chat in Zoom.
- Weekly breakout rooms so that students can discuss any topics they feel confused about. Then I answer their questions in a smaller scale setting where they feel less embarrassed about being confused.
- The class starts very early in the morning. So to give people a time to wake up and trickle in, I spend a few minutes sharing something interesting I read unrelated to the material we're learning. Often the students feel more comfortable making comments about these topics. Usually this only lasts a few minutes, but sometimes - like when talking about gamestonks - students got really interested.

Get one:
1. smaller groups for deeper discussion
2. polls or other interactive methods to get feedback in class (poll everywhere, I think)
3. multiple opportunities for participation - such as using the chat on Zoom, Canvas discussion boards...remembering that participation can look like something other than just unmuting on Zoom.
4. Ask the students for examples.
5. (To watch: Fargo)
6. Time to think and then peer work. 
7. Ask students to find an image online. Something related to their hobbies as an icebreaker.
8. Use Google Docs for student collaboration.
