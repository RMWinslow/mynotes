To summarize [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_conception_of_the_soul),
these are the pieces of the soul, according to ancient Egyptians:

Khet
: The physical form, the body. Preserved via mummification to keep the entire soul whole.

Sah
: The spritual (form of the) body. The [ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khonsuemheb_and_the_Ghost). Avenging spirits.

Jb
: The literal heart. Seat of emotion, thought, will and intention. [Weighed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_afterlife_beliefs#Judgement_of_the_dead) against the feather of Maat.

Ka
: The vital essence. The spirit. The force which seperates a living body from a dead one. Sustained from food. The dead consume the ka of food offerings, but not the physical substance.

Ba
: The personality. The person themself. The special je ne sais quoi that makes you you. Funeral rights must be performed to free the ba from the dead body so it can reunite with the ka.

Shut
: The shadow. The silhouette. The literal shadow of a person, and servant of anubis. Statues are also shadows. Also the deeds of the person; the effect they had on the world.

Sekhem
: ??? Power, form? Translation difficulties. Might be name for underworld.

Ren
: The name. Persists as long as the naem is spoken. Identity, experiences, memories. Cartouche protects it.

Akh
: The magically effective one. Intellect divorced from thought. Glowy. Can intercede for one's family via prayer, like a personal saint. Formed when Ka and Ba reunite post death.
