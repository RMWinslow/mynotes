The CDC has a [page here](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) where they report the numbers of vaccines distributed to each state, 
as well as the number of vaccines administered.
WSJ has a derivative graph on [this page](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuomo-defends-fines-for-hospitals-slow-to-vaccinate-for-covid-19-11609886806)
where they report the percentage of the population inncolated. 
(Presumably just by divinding administered by population)

A few things worth noting:




## South Dakota and West Virginia Stronk

As of today, these are the two states with more than 3% of their population vaccinated, accoridn to WSJ



## KS, wat r u doing?!

Edit A while later: the Gov wasn't BSing. KS rocketed up in terms of vaccines, just like the visit with Rob suggested. It's solidly middle of the pack, despite lower vaccine allocations. It has above average percent of population vaccinated.

KS, sadly enough, has the lowest portion of its population vaccinated, according to WSJ.
And looking at the CDC map, it's not just a matter of not getting the vaccines. A low portion of doses distributed have been administered.

Why?

reports that Gov Kelly claims KS just has reporting delays due to desimination to rural communities.

> The governor said she wished data was getting into the system in real-time but that "we are getting vaccines in people's arms."  
> "In fact, I think Kansas has probably one of the most efficient systems set up ... where we are using a hub and spoke, whereas other states are just using a hub," Kelly said. 

> "A big part of this is that in a lot of other states, they’re focusing on urban distribution with just a few vaccination centers, whereas we’re distributing statewide to 105 counties. That’s a lot of providers to get data from into one system," state Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood, said in a social media post.   
> The state has emphasized its desire to target rural and urban areas simultaneously, and most Kansas counties have reported having received vaccine doses. That is different from some other states, where some rural hospitals haven't yet received the vaccine.

Also claims that KS has [prexisting vaccine database](https://www.kdheks.gov/immunize/immunization_registry.htm#undefined) which is different from CDC's shiny special SARS2 database, and that's causing confusion.

Also claims that KS distribution scheme makes more sense:

> The state opted to push out vaccines to larger health departments in a region first, with the agencies then charged with forwarding shipments to their smaller neighbors, Kriesel said.  
> But he noted this wasn't always communicated properly, which was especially confusing because the vaccines actually arrived before KDHE could properly notify all the departments of the plan.

USAtoday quotes a KU dude who does think that KS legitmately is having delays. 

> But Scott Stites, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System, said more work was needed to refine the process, even as he noted health care providers had become more efficient at doling out the shots.  
> "We're still lagging behind on getting doses into arms," he said. "We need to work on our logistics."

Tangentially related: [outreach efforts](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/covid-19-vaccine-will-save-black-lives-black-doctors-urge-kansas-citians/ar-BB1cuT3D) to convince black KC residents to get vaccine.





## Bizarre Regulation coming out of New York and California.

New York Governor Cuomo issues order promising up to $1,000,000 fines for administering vaccines to wrong people.

Result is very lower vaccination rate.

So then Cuomo promises huge fines if hospitals have unused doses. ...


Wat.











## In contrast: Isreal

Haven't read the primary sources,
but [here's a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1344735831655936001)
making the argument that Isreal is doing best with vaccines
bc it focuses on speed instead of strict beaureaucratic prioritization.

Example: 

> End of the day in a vaccine center. A few doses left and will expire. Nurses go out, spot a pizza delivery guy, call him "pizza guy wanna vaccine?", jab, and another person has spike mRNA!
