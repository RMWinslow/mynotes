[A useful starting point.](https://gist.github.com/maxogden/97190db73ac19fc6c1d9beee1a6e4fc8)

## To go from markdown to pdf:

```
-C -N -s SOURCEFILE.md -o OUTPUTFILE.pdf
```

The `-C` is short for `--citeproc` and the `-N` is short for `--number-sections`

Additionally, the YAML frontmatter should look something like this:

```yaml
---
title: This is the title of the paper.
author: Robert Winslow
date: xxxx xx xx
abstract: |
    The bar makes pandoc interpret the rest of the indented section as one argument.
    So this is include in the abstract.

    As is this.
bibliography: MYBIB.bib
link-citations: true
classoption:
- twocolumn
csl: LOCALCSLFILE.csl
---
```

CSL defines citation format. [See here for example.](https://csl.mendeley.com/styleInfo/?styleId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zotero.org%2Fstyles%2Fchicago-author-date).
Though I can't get that option to work in my testing.


(I prefer to have parameters saved inside the markdown file itself if possible.)
