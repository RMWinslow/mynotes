The [main article here](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper) is kind of a waste of time. Lots of advice like "read the title first".

The [linked humor article](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/01/how-read-scientific-paper) is pretty funny though.

> Can you imagine if mainstream magazine articles were like science papers? Picture a Time cover story with 48 authors. Or a piece in The Economist that required, after every object described, a parenthetical listing of the company that produced the object and the city where that company is based. Or a People editorial about Jimmy Kimmel that could only be published following a rigorous review process by experts in the field of Jimmy Kimmel.

> Do you know what you’d call a magazine article that required intellectual scrutiny and uninterrupted neural commitment to figure out what it’s even trying to say? You’d call it a badly written article.

> So for those new to reading journals, welcome. Good luck. And we’re sorry. We’re trying to write articles comprehensibly, but sometimes our subdiscipline is so hyperspecific that we need a million acronyms. And sometimes we’re attempting to sound like good scientists by copying the tone of every article we’ve read. And sometimes we’re just writing badly.

[Here is a comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24988706) with some links to other papers about reading papers.

Papers written for experts are different than papers written for layman. Survey papers as examples of well-written stuff.

> I prefer having occasional well-written review papers, meant for getting non-experts up to speed. Then the domain experts - who are often not experts at writing for laymen - can refer people to those review papers, possibly also with a history delta for what's new since the review.

>That's the problem i see with a lot of news reporting on science papers. They use the gp's method of reading. Abstract, images and maybe results if they're really trying.  
That's how you end up with a lot of sensationalist, contradictory science headlines.

> One of the best ways into a new area is if you can find a well written PhD or MSc thesis in it. Finding that isn't always easy, but if they are well done the background introductory material will be approachable and much more complete than a paper, and the bibliography should be useful.

### Comparison of different fields:

> In biology the intro is typically not too long and generally gives just enough info so that even if a person was just browsing the journal they can get enough context about the field and topic and get a list of pre read references they can look back to if needed. The perfect introduction would ideally give you an introduction and a reading list that by itself would bring you up to speed to where the paper is starting from, without any need for second level reference digging!

> I've noticed often that papers in biology (systems biology in my experience at least) go directly to the point with some amount of context and history leading upto the main results of the paper. This is something that's suprisingly lacking in engineering, where reading a paper or grasping the context usually requires at least some amount of prior learning.

> I also have the impression that CS papers all too often recapitulate the topic's history. ... I also have the impression that CS papers all too often recapitulate the topic's history.

### Advice for electronic note-taking and paper tracking

NalNezumi takes notes on paper and then 

> I make a .txt summary file of the article, after I've thoroughly read the paper, where I write down all the notes I made on the print (+ a summary) and store it digitally.  
It takes extra time, and might feel wasteful, but I usually do it some days/week after I read the paper, for a spaced repetition purpose too.

maxioatic recommends a few pieces of software:
- [Polar](https://getpolarized.io/) for reading, storing, and annotating them
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)  for [storing meta data](https://www.zotero.org/support/retrieve_pdf_metadata) about the papers 
- "My current thoughts are to move more to Zotero because it also has some annotation functionality, but primarily use it as an extraction point to then store these annotations/notes in plain text or markdown. Which then I'll manage with git or something."
