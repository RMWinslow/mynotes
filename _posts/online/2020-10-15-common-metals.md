## Aluminum

Packaging, construction, transportation

Pros
: Abundant, recyclable, corrosion-resistant

Cons
: weaker and/or more expensive than steel

## Bronze

Copper and Tin. Springs, bearings, and bushings

Pros
: conductive, corrosion-resistant

Cons
: soft, weak, expensive


## Carbon Steel

Iron and carbon.

Lower carbon makes it squishier and easier to deform.

Higher carbon  and makes it harder and more expensive.

### Low carbon steel

0.05–0.320% carbon. Cheap and common

### Medium carbon steel

0.30–0.59% carbon. Large parts, car parts, forging

### High carbon steel

0.6–0.99% carbon. Springs, strong wires.

### Ultra High carbon steel

1.0–2.0% carbon. Knives, axles, punches


## Nickel

Often alloyed with steel. Magnets, coins, batteries, green tint in glas.

Pros
: Hard but ductile, corrosion resistant, magenetic, high melting point

Cons
: Can cause dermatitis 


## Titanium

Alloyed to make space-age metals.

Pro
: High melting point, low conductivity, highest strength-to-density ratio.

Con
: difficult to extract.
