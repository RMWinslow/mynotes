Looking through public domain vectors on [Openclipart](https://openclipart.org/)
I came across [this site](https://comicbookplus.com/) alleging to host comics in the public domain.

But these comics are from the 50s, not the 20s, so how can they be PD?
Well, the site claims for example that 
> Skywald did not put the proper copyright on their black and white magazine so they were public domain when published. The comics do have proper copyright.

This sounded like bs to me, but seems to be true.

[From this article](https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/copyright/works-in-the-public-domain/):

> Any work published before 1923 is in the public domain, as is any work produced by an employee of the federal government in their official capacity. Works published between 1923 and 1977 generally receive copyright protection for 95 years from the date of their publication. If the work was published in 1978 or later, even if it was created before then, protection usually extends for 70 years after the author of the work dies. Distinctive rules apply to works made for hire or works that were published anonymously or under a pseudonym. Rights for these works last for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is less. (If the author’s name is eventually disclosed to the U.S. Copyright Office, the usual term of 70 years after the author’s death applies.)

> Works that were published between 1923 and 1963 were subject to renewal requirements. You can consult the records of the U.S. Copyright Office to find out if the author failed to renew the copyright. This would mean that the work has fallen into the public domain, even if less than 95 years have passed since the date of publication. ... If you are looking for a work published in 1950 or later, you can find the renewal records at the Copyright Office website. 

[From this article](http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/copyright-symbol.html):

> Copyright notices on published works (which may or may not include the copyright symbol) became optional in the US when Congress enacted the Berne Convention Implementation Act. It took effect March 1, 1989. Since then no works — published or unpublished — need a notice. (The copyright notice has never been required on unpublished works.)
> 
> So today, lack of a copyright symbol (or other appropriate notice) doesn’t mean the work is in the public domain. Just because there’s no copyright notice, don’t assume it’s public domain. Because prior law did require a valid copyright notice on published works, though, its presence or absence is still relevant to the copyright status of older works.
> A work published before March 1, 1989, without a valid copyright notice may be in the public domain (if the lack of notice was not excused, that is). For example, the classic horror film Night of the Living Dead (1968) is in the public domain for this reason.
> 
> Works published before January 1, 1978, are governed by the previous copyright law (the 1909 copyright act). Under the 1909 Act (which covers works published from July 1, 1909 through December 31, 1977), copyright generally came into being upon publication with notice. If a work was published under the copyright owner’s authority without a proper notice of copyright, all copyright protection for that work was permanently lost in the United States.
> 
> Note: That’s the general rule, anyway. The 1909 Act includes a section that says, basically, that if the notice was omitted by accident or mistake from a small number of copies, the copyright was still valid. The copyright owner must have attempted to comply with the notice requirement, though, and those who were misled by the lack of notice weren’t liable for damages.


> Okay, enough with the examples. Here’s the bottom line: if the work was first published in the US from 1923 through March 1, 1989, without a valid copyright notice (copyright symbol, etc., as explained above) ... it’s most likely in the public domain. For those works the copyright clock never started ticking — they never got a term of protection at all.
