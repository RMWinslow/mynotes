[How to remember what you learn](https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/)

- Make it time-based
- Take regular breaks
- Learn what you are curious about.

### Time-based

Goals based on time focused instead of "pages read" or the like

### Take breaks

3h learning sessions split into 30 min intervals with 5 min breaks

move around and stand up during break



## Learning Sessions

Study material on the right, 
text editor on the left

three files:

- A file with a timestamp where my random thoughts go.
- A file with a timestamp where I think about the subject.
- A file with questions.

I have the first in a file called papersdrafts -> geneneralideas.md
Should maybe add timestamps

Second file should be full of metacognition

> When I’m beginning a new session, I always start from the previous one’s questions file. I only look at questions and answer them before I’m beginning new learning.


## After the Session

- Three to five sentence summary of what was just studied.
- Write down the answers to three questions
    - What are the key ideas?
    - How can I apply this knowledge that I learned?
    - How do these ideas relate to what I already know?

He also uses the anki thing for speaced repition of these questions


### Other activities

- talk to friends about what was learned
- anki spaced repetition
- open a file in the evening and type what you recall from the day
- some advice about keeping a big list of things to potentially read
    - amazon book samples to identify new books to read
    - but I feel like this would just spiral out of my control in terms of organization


## Building habits

Make it time based.
Start small
Do it every day

Remove distractions

> When I begin learning, I leave my phone in a different room. That way, I’m not tempted to use it just because it gets into my perception. This trick saved me a ton of time and energy, so I welcome you to try it out as well. As you may have guessed correctly, this extends way beyond learning; I apply the same approach to my work. When I sit down to write, I leave all potential distractions (including my wife) in a different room. Immensely helpful.
