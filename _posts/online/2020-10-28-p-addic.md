Alternative way to complete the rationals.

To include the limits of every sequence, we need to define limits. To define limits, we need distance.

Instead of using 
$$d(x,y) \equiv |x-y|$$
, instead we use 
$$d(x,y) \equiv |x-y|_p$$
where 
$$|x|_p$$
is defined using the following process:

## Step 1: define p-adic order

Choose some prime $p$. (We get different fields at the end for different $p$).

For integers, the p-adic order of $x$, denoted $v_p(x)$ is the number of times $x$ can be divided by $p$, and $v_p(0)=\infty$ by convention: 

$$
v_p(x) = \begin{cases}
			\max\{ v\in\mathbb{N} : x / p^v \in \mathbb{N} \}, & \text{if $n \neq 0$}\\
            \infty, & \text{if $n = 0$}
		 \end{cases}
$$

For rational numbers in general, look at the simplest fraction representation of $x$, where $x=\frac{t}{b}$ for some unique (up to sign) coprime integers.
Then if the top integer has $p$ as a factor, $v_p(x)=v_p(t)$, and if the bottom integer has $p$ as a factor, $v_p(x)= - v_p(b)$. Equivalently, we can write:

$$v_p\left(\frac{t}{b}\right) = v_p(t) - v_p(b)$$

### Example: 2-adic order

For integers, this is the number of trailing zeros in base 2 notation.

$v_p(x) = 0$ for odd numbers: $x=1,3,5,...$ etc.

$v_p(x) = 1$ for evens not divisible by 4: $x=2,6,10,14,18,...$ etc.

$v_p(x) = 2$ for $x=4,12,20,28,36,...$ etc.

$v_p(x) = 3$ for $x=8,24,40,56,...$ etc.

|Decimal|Binary|2-adic order (decimal)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0|0|$\infty$|
|1|1|0|
|2|10|1|
|3|11|0|
|4|100|2|
|5|101|0|
|8|1000|3|
|9|1001|0|
|36 |100100|2|
|56|111000|3|



<!--
And this kindof works for fractions where the denominator is $2^n$

### Example: 10-adic order

10 isn't a prime, but whatever. For integers, 10-adic order is simply the number of trailing zeros:

$v_p(x) = 1$ for $x=10,20,30,40,...,110,120,...3289730, -10,-20,$ etc.

$v_p(x) = 2$ for $x=100,200,300,400,...,1100,1200,...9041300, -100,$ etc.

$v_p(x) = 3$ for $x=1000,2000,3000,4000,...9000,11000,12000,...8675309000,$ etc.

$v_p(1,000,000)=6$. 

$v_p(x) = 0$ for $x=1,2,3,4,...9,11,12,13,...19,21,...36546841, -37,$ etc.

And this kindof extends to rationals which have a denominator of $10^n$

$v_p(x) = -1$ for $x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 159.7, 2457.1,$ etc. Doesn't always work. $0.15$, for example.-->


## Step 2: Define the p-adic absolute value

This is simply 
$$|x|_p \equiv p^{-v_p(x)}$$ 

So $|x|_2=1$ for all odd integers and less than one for all even integers.

And $|0|_p=0$ for any $p$
