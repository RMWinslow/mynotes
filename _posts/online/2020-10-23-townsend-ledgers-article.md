I had thought Bitcoin's innovation was the distributed ledger. But he says DL predates Bitcoin

### Non-crypto examples of payment tech with similar principles:

- shipping giant Maersk has combined with IBM to build a distributed ledger system for its business
- The Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs TReDS platform lets merchants directly receive trade receivables (money owed to them) through distributed ledger principles
- open-source money-transfer platform Stellar allows transactions between decentralized servers that synchronize every few seconds; 
- another firm, Ripple, operates in similar fashion.
- Kenya M-PESA
  - used by 90 percent of Kenyans who lack bank accounts
  - deposit funds and transfers them at parity with Kenyan shilling
  - Tavneet Suri show M-PESA helps spread risk effectively ü§î
  - "However, Safaricom offers no collateral for user deposits, so there are customer risks. And the M-PESA network runs through agents, 60 percent of whom lack liquidity at least once per month."



### Townsend Thai Project:  

20-year research effort Townsend oversaw, starting in the 1990s, which collected monthly financial data from hundreds of households in several provinces

How can ledgers help poor people?

Thai baht is heavily paper-intensive. 
Thailand  richer than neighbors, immigrants come, send money to family.
Platforms like Stellar make such remittances cheaper and faster.
Cross-country transfers without fiat money changing hands.

Also useful to fill gap in  ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contracts and escrow services
"But since distributed ledger technologies offer a platform where two parties can make synchronized exchanges, they can substitute for the escrow process."
"farmers could deliver goods without getting burned by bogus payments."
