## Decompoising tasks into concrete steps

- This meant knowing which component tasks made up a larger goal,
-  tracking how long certain types of tasks took me to complete and 
-  using that data to set deadlines that were reasonable. 
-  I shifted my approach from “write a chapter” to assigning actionable tasks to work sessions, such as “write a mind map for the first analysis section” or “draft a one-page description of my method.”

*The first 3 seem empirically not something I can easily implement.*

## Planning work sessions

- Every time I sat down at my desk, I determined one to three actionable and achievable goals 
- monotask to achieve flow. *Gee, what great advice. To do the thing, just do the thing instead of other things.*
- target goals to deliberately induce flow state


## Focus tools

- Pomodoro
- Co working
- website blockers

*Last one is a huge help. Already tried the first two. Also, doesn't pomodoro explicitly contradict monotasking*

## Shift perpective to compromise more

- "a good dissertation is a done dissertation"
- using comments function to write drafting notes. *(maybe I can just put stuff in italics)*
- Ask adviser for depth of material. One or two examples. No unecessary deep dives.
- Tracked progress by words written but also by time worked.

## Other tips

- strict stop and start times
- took time off due to brain fog. *Aeeiiee. That's the issue. I'm reading this article for tips on how to **not have brain fog**, not for the advice of "stop working when you have trouble" groumble grumble*
