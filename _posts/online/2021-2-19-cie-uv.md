Interesting little video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYwjzjuWj0Q&feature=youtu.be)

- UV-C radiation can be used to disinfect surfaces
- Chemical and heat sterilization is preferred in most cases because
    - UV-C cannot be safely used on human skin or eyes.
    - UV-C causes degredation of many plastics.
- UV systems installed inside air ducts is an excellent way to disinfect air for controlling spread of virus.
- There are also systems where you wheel it in and then leave the room to let the light sterilize the surfaces.
