## Enclosure

Basic story:
- England used to have fuedal lands, where the tenants have to pay rents *and* do labor to grow food for the lord, and also they couldn't leave. Sucks. 
- Over the course of several centuries, farmland mostly become enclosed, owned and operated by private individuals. Sometimes lords (new boss same as the old) but often Yeoman.
- Started a bit from plagues leaving empty land then the gov sorta forced it through.
- Pros: 
    - End of fuedalism,
    - Massive increases in agriculture productivity and innovation. Enables the use of techniques such as clover planting to rejuvenate soil that wasn't possible in commonly grazed pastures.
    - Large food surpluses, which leads to large labor surpluses, which enables the industrial revolution
- Cons:
    - Sometimes the land enclosures were top down and forced through in stupid ways, displacing people from their land
    - Large food surpluses, which leads to large labor surpluses, which enables the industrial revolution


## Soviet history stuff

Lenin does his whole terror thing. Takes over, tries to top down manage the country. Things go poorly. Lenin switches back to 'state capitalism', things go well. Lenin dies. Stalin takes over. Back to the communism!

Notable iin that the collectivization of farms is something russian peasants strongly resisted. But wiki sand internet speak in largely negative terms of english decollectivization of farms.
I wonder if this is like the romanticization of Sparta, wherein people idealize a brutal slave-based society (fuedal commons, ancient sparta) because the historically notable people benefitted from it?
