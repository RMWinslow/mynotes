In class, Fatih mentioned the new field of research into business cycles as characterized by "second moment shocks" (variance, uncertainty) as opposed to first moment shocks (average tfp)

[Nick Bloom](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/research) is said to have some good summaries on the matter.

## Stuff to Look at:

[Bloom, Nicholas (2014). **"Fluctuations in uncertainty."** *Journal of Economic Perspectives 28, no. 2*: 153-76.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.2.153)
: A summary of the recent rise in research into the relationship between economic uncertainty and business cycles.

[Bloom, N. (2009). **"The impact of uncertainty shocks."** *econometrica*, 77(3), 623-685.](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/uncertaintyshocks.pdf)
: Builds a model of the effects of an uncertainty shock. Predicts that such shocks cause short sharp recessions and rapid recoveries.

[Baker, S. R., Bloom, N., & Davis, S. J. (2016). **Measuring economic policy uncertainty.** *The quarterly journal of economics*, 131(4), 1593-1636.](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/qje_bbd.pdf)
: Tries to index policy uncertainty based on newspaper coverage.

[Bloom, N., Floetotto, M., Jaimovich, N., Saporta‐Eksten, I., & Terry, S. J. (2018). **Really uncertain business cycles.** *Econometrica, 86(3)*, 1031-1065.](https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/ecta10927.pdf)
: "our data and simulations suggest recessions are best modelled as being driven by shocks
with a negative first moment and a positive second moment."

## Fluctations in Uncertainty

> Both
macro and micro uncertainty appear to rise sharply in recessions and fall in booms.
Uncertainty also varies heavily across countries—developing countries appear to
have about one-third more macro uncertainty than developed countries.

> Greater uncertainty appears
to reduce the willingness of fi rms to hire and invest, and consumers to spend. However,
there is also some evidence that uncertainty can stimulate research and development—
faced with a more uncertain future, some fi rms appear more willing to innovate.

- what are some facts and patterns about economic uncertainty?
- why does uncertainty vary during business cycles? 
- do fluctuations in uncertainty affect behavior? 
- has higher uncertainty worsened the Great Recession and slowed the recovery?
