## How to read a paper from Stamferd

[This article](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) is linked in the [Hacker news comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24986727) for [this other article.](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper)

This article is more useful and also has writing advice.

### Three-pass approach:

1. First pass: skim to get gist
   1. Read title abstract and intro
   2. read the headings, but ignore everything else
   3. read conclusion
   4. Glance at references to see which you've read
2. Second pass: Read carefully
   1. Read the whole paper, but ignore details like proofs.
   2. Jot down key points or comments as you read.
   3. Look carefully at figures. Check for labelling, error bars, and shoddy work.
   4. Mark relevant refereces for future reading
3. Third pass: virtually re-implement the paper.
   1. Make the same assumptions as the authors and try to recreate their work.
   1. Think about how you would present the idea.
   2. Jot down ideas for future work.

First pass should take 5 minutes and tells you whether to read it. When writing a paper, expect reviewers and readers to only do the first pass.

Second pass should take an hour and should equip you to summarize it to someone else. Stop here if you are interested in the topic but it isn't your research speciality.

Third pass should take an hour. (4-5 hours for beginners). You should be able to identify implicit assumptiuons, strong and weak points, and missing citations.

### Doing a literature survey:

1. Use Google Scholar or CiteSeer to find 3-5 *recent* papers in the area. 
2. Do first pass on each
3. read their related work sections.
4. Try to find a recent survey paper. If you can, then read that and you're done.
5. If you can't find a recent survey:
   1.  find shared cites and author names. these are key papers/researchers. Download the key papers and set them aside.
   2. Go to websites of top authors and see where they've published.
   3. Go to the websites for those conferences and look through recent proceedings for high-quality work.
   4. Papers from steps 5.1 and 5.3 are first pass your your survey.
   5. If they all cite another key paper, find that one, and iterate.
