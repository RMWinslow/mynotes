A factoid I heard from John Oliver is that Police steal more from people (via civil asset forfeiture) than criminals do. 
Is this true? Kind of. It's truthyish. 

Civil asset forfeiture is significant, and reaks of [perverse incentives](http://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/policing-for-profit-2nd-edition.pdf). 

> The seeds of forfeiture abuse were sown in 1984
when Congress expanded federal civil forfeiture laws and
created a financial incentive for law enforcement to forfeit
property. Before then, all forfeited cash and proceeds
from forfeited property had gone to the general fund of
the U.S. Treasury. But starting in the mid-1980s, forfeiture
revenue instead went to a newly created fund controlled
by federal law enforcement. As a result, all federal forfeiture revenue can go back to the very agencies charged
with enforcing the law, giving them a financial stake in
forfeiture efforts. S

But that particular statistic needs a bunch of caveats on it.

The actual statement is that in 2014, the total volume of civil asset forfeitures was larger than the total value of burgled property reported to the FBI.

## Criminal Theft:


Here's some data on the total amount of theft from the FBI. Units are billions of USD.

| Year | Robbery | Burglary | Larceny | Auto Theft | total |
|------|---------|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| 2012 | 0.34    | 4.13     | 5.29    | 3.85       | 13.61 |
| 2013 | 0.35    | 4.05     | 6.79    | 3.90       | 15.09 |
| 2014 | 0.35    | 3.45     | 4.81    | 4.00       | 12.61 |
| 2015 | 0.38    | 3.23     | 4.66    | 4.47       | 12.74 |

Total found by multiplying "number of offenses" by "Average value". 
Disagrees with table 24 because that table has fewer reporting agencies.

> The data presented in Crime in the United States reflect the Hierarchy Rule, which requires that only the most serious offense in a multiple-offense criminal incident be counted. In descending order of severity, the violent crimes are murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, followed by the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. Although arson is also a property crime, the Hierarchy Rule does not apply to the offense of arson. In cases in which arson occurs in conjunction with another violent or property crime, both crimes are reported.

Robbery
: "The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines robbery as the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear."

Burglary
: "The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines burglary as the unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. To classify an offense as a burglary, the use of force to gain entry need not have occurred. The UCR Program has three subclassifications for burglary: forcible entry, unlawful entry where no force is used, and attempted forcible entry. The UCR definition of “structure” includes an apartment, barn, house trailer or houseboat when used as a permanent dwelling, office, railroad car (but not automobile), stable, and vessel (i.e., ship)."

Larceny-theft
: "The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines larceny-theft as the unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession or constructive possession of another. Examples are thefts of bicycles, motor vehicle parts and accessories, shoplifting, pocket-picking, or the stealing of any property or article that is not taken by force and violence or by fraud. Attempted larcenies are included. Embezzlement, confidence games, forgery, check fraud, etc., are excluded."

<!--This feels off. Not sure why. "For the 2014 population estimates used in this table, the FBI computed individual rates of growth from one year to the next for every city/town and county using 2010 decennial population counts and 2011 through 2013 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each agency’s rates of growth were averaged; that average was then applied and added to its 2013 Census population estimate to derive the agency’s 2014 population estimate."-->

## Civil Asset Forfeiture

Harder to find aggregates for.

<!--[This post has some details.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/). NVM. Kinda garbage article tbh.-->


Then federal data is easier to find.

Institute for justice has done the work of going through the audits.

Combination of DoJ and Treasury forfeitures

Units are billions of dollars still.

Sources include comparison to previous year.

Still doesn't perfectly match the IoJ data, but at least it's in the right ballpark. 


## Comparing amounts


- So in 2012, for the first time, federal forefeiture revenue exceeded total burglaries.
- The Forf rev peaked in the 2012-2015 era, mostly because of Madoff.
- It's plateaued since but burglary has also falled so continued years where forf reve more than burg value.
- In no year did forf rev get even close to the total amount criminally stolen.

IoJ suspects part of the overall increase from the 80s is due to better reporting.

### Composition of stolen goods

Something else I found interesting is that FBI stats suggest 1-2 percentish of the value of stolen property is stolen firearms. Cite for [2014](https://www.justice.gov/afp/file/5-yr_forfeiture_trends.pdf/download) [2015](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-24) [2019](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/table-24)

Compare to the [chart of seized assets here](https://www.justice.gov/afp/file/5-yr_forfeiture_trends.pdf/download) on page 2, claiming that from 2014-2018, "about 62 percent of all seizures have been firearms, ammunition,
and explosives".
Chart on page 3 shows downward trend in cash and vehicles seizure events, but shaky upwards trend in firearms seizures.
"A sharp
decrease in seizures of valued assets has been replaced by a 19 percent increase in firearms
and ammunition seizures"

Not a perfect comparison because one is type per seizure, the other is type per dollar stolen. 
Also not specifically civil assets forfeitures? Not sure.

Also compare to state [forfeiture data from IoJ](https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/pfp3content/forfeiture-is-lucrative-for-governments-nationwide/what-do-states-forfeit-cash-is-king/), where states primarily seize cash. 

Also Treasury Forfeitures are mostly cash.

Looking at tables in DoJ reports, value of firearms is not calculated. So I think they aren't added to value of total property seized.
-->


<!--Am I interpretting page 11 properly? In 2017-18 reporting period, less than 1% of forfeitures were the straight-up highway roberry style template? That's still too many of course. But that's less dramatic than John Oliver suggests-->

(all numbers are nominal)

[This article](https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/) has an interesting chart. They claim it costs 3k to fight a forfeiture and then plot this line compared to the average size of cash forfeitures.

In fact, the [entire online report](https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/pfp3content/introduction/#postlanding) is wonderfully formatted. Coherently arranged sidebar, relvant sources on each page. Lovely. Though some of the sources seem missing.

[Interesting](https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/pfp3content/forfeiture-is-lucrative-for-governments-nationwide/big-time-criminals-or-small-time-forfeitures/#citation_1).
El Chapo is also large recent source of forfeiture maybe.
High averages, but low median.
Florida has high median, potentially because of reform which imposes 1000 dollar filing fee for police agency try to seize property.
