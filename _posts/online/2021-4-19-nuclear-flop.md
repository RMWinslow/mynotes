[Why has nuclear power been a flop?](https://rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop)
A blogpost summary of the book by Jack Devanney.

Which makes this a summary of a summary... Hrm...

Need to at least triple energy use to bring globe up to EU standards of living.

Linear No Threshold model for radiation use by EPA and NRC but probably not true.
(That alleviates most of my concerns about airline travel.)


ALARA
: As Low As Reasonably Achievable.

But this means Nuclear cannot by definition become cheaper than competitors, and removes incentives to make sensible improvements.

Lots of stupid counterproductive regulations.

**Perverse incentives:** "the NRC does not benefit when power plants come online. Their budget does not increase proportional to gigawatts generated. Instead, the nuclear companies themselves pay the NRC for the time they spend reviewing applications, at something close to $300 an hour." ***!!!!***

If nuclear was primary power source, there would be an accident every few years. But only Chernobyl killed substantial amounts of people. Nobody directly died from radiation from Three Mile. A few died from Fukushima. Many many people died from the overreaction to Fukushima.

NRC doesn't let you test reactor designs without a license. You can't get a license until all the safety concerns have been tested.
“test the weld, not the welder.”

[Hanford site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site) cleanup employs 8000 people, costs 2.5 billion per year, despite radiation levels being without range of background radiation. TODO: Is this an accurate claim?

From wiki: "The highest tritium concentration detected in riverbank springs during 2002 was 58,000 pCi/L (2,100 Bq/L) at the Hanford Townsite. The highest iodine-129 concentration of 0.19 pCi/L (0.007 Bq/L) was also found in a Hanford Townsite spring. The WHO guidelines for radionuclides in drinking-water limits levels of iodine-129 at 1 Bq/L, and tritium at 10,000 Bq/L". Article is generally confusing. Lots of anecdotes of health problems mixed in with statements that the relevant toxins were all well below safe levels.

Overall, some interesting reads, and placing the blame on misaligned incentives certainly appeals to my biases. But the author has conflicts of interest and his website is shady and annoying.

## [What's wrong with being cautious?, by Theodore Rockwell](http://radiationeffects.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rockwell-NN-1997_Whats-wrong-with-being-cautious.pdf) (1997)

> Let me describe five different kinds of harm: billions of dollars wasted, ridiculous regulations imposed that degrade the credibility of science and government, destructive fear generated, detrimental health effects created, and environmental degradation accelerated. Current regulations define as "radioactively contaminated" material that gives off less radiation than the natural background where people have lived happy and healthy for many generations. Storing even low-level radioactive waste requires multimillion-dollar studies with gro-tesque scenarios of atoms migrating through miles of desert soil to "contaminate" a possible water source in the distant future--water whose natural radioactivity would already be far above that of the mythical contaminant.

> Let's look at a few examples. Some years ago (as described by Bob Bromm, who was there working for EG&G), a forklift at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL--now the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory) moved a small spent fuel cask from the storage pool to the hot cell. The cask had not been properly drained prior to its removal from the storage pool area, and so some pool water was dribbled onto the blacktop along the way. Despite the fact that a couple of characters had taken a midnight swim in such a pool in the days when I used to visit there and were none the worse for it, storage pool water is defined as a hazardous contaminant. It was deemed necessary, therefore, to dig up the entire path of the forklift, creating a trench two feet wide by a half-mile long that was dubbed Toomer's Creek, after the unfortunate worker whose job it was to ensure that the cask was fully drained. 
> 
> The Bannock Paving Company was hired to repave the entire road. Bannock used slag from the local phosphate plants as aggregate in their blacktop, which had proved to be highly satisfactory in many of the roads in the Pocatello, Idaho, area that were paved with 
this mix. After the job at INEL was complete, it was learned that the aggregate was naturally high in thorium and was actually more radioactive than the material that had been dug up, marked with the dreaded radiation symbol, and hauled away for expensive, long-term burial.

> We arrived at this situation not through stupidity or malice, but through a fairly reasonable historical process. Radiation protection standards and criteria were drawn up rather quickly after the first X-ray experimenters began to get radiation burns on their hands a hundred years ago. Those first experiences were limited to localized exposures to soft X rays. But after the Manhattan Project's dramatic entrance onto the world stage at Hiroshima, a more varied stable of radiant beasts had to be classified and protected against. Intensive research on mice was begun, to set occupational exposure limits. Evidence of the lack of health effects at low dose was ignored in the effort to catalog the various effects at high levels. Using Japanese survivors as a new source of data, an international team of physicians and scientists began to compare the health of those exposed to radiation with others who had not been exposed. This study has now gone on for more than 50 years and is looking at the third generation of survivors. A roughly linear relationship between radiation dose and various health effects (principally cancers) emerged for the region of about 40 to 600 rem and these data were used to set the standard, along with what laboratory and field data were available. The A-bomb radiation was delivered almost instantaneously, and it is known that radiation received over a longer period, as would be typical in occupational exposure, enables repair and healing to take place. Ignoring healing effects was just left as a conservatism--and a large one--since reliable quantitative data on the effect of dose rate on health effects were scarce. 
> 
> Below about 40 rem, there were no observable health effects. But it was felt that cancers or genetic effects might show up decades later. So it was considered prudent at that time (in the early 1950s) to draw a straight line from the data to zero dose (see box, previous page). Statements made on the record at that time show that this was an administrative decision, made for radiation protection purposes; it was not made in light of what is now known about the molecular and cell biology of radiation damage. It was the same sort of decision that medieval popes made when they drew straight lines across maps of Africa and South America to divide up the turf. It seemed like a good idea at the time; the problems arose later.

> Three Mile Island's release of a few curies of radioactivity (plus relatively harmless inert gases) was considered the world's worst catastrophe until Chernobyl released several million curies. For people used to working with microcuries, these were tremendous numbers. A typical headline-making leak might involve a few millicuries. But we have to ask: compared with what? We live in a sitzbath of radioactivity and we should judge these numbers against those already given us by Nature. 
>
> The soils of the world contain uranium and thorium, and about 2 billion curies of radon produced from natural decay of these elements is released into the air each year. Uranium in the earth's core decays slowly, releasing heat equivalent to burning 1 million tons of coal per hour. This natural, nonfissioning nuclear power plant releases energy at four times the entire electrical generating capacity of the United States, keeping the earth's center molten. The world's oceans contain about 400 billion curies of potassium-40, 4 billion curies of rubidium-87, 1 billion curies of uranium, 200 million curies of carbon-14, and 20 million curies of tritium. These are numbers to keep in mind when we talk about "contaminating" the planet.
> 
> This natural radioactivity in our soil, air, water, and food, plus the bombardment of cosmic rays from beyond the galaxy, gives us a natural radiation background of about 300 mrem per year, with many locations on earth that are many times greater than this. The NRC presently requires a site to be cleaned down to 15 mrem per year in order for it to be freed for public use, and is considering raising this number to 25 mrem per year. As I write this, the EPA is telling the public, as well as the NRC, that this will result in "nearly doubling the allowed level of cancer risk to the public" and is therefore "simply unacceptably high." This is the kind of policy that has been properly characterized as "deeply immoral use of our scientific heritage." 

Though I want to note that nuclear *bomb* testing did have noticeable impacts on the atmospheric presence of a bunch of isotopes. Messed with carbon dating and makes old sunken ships a valuable commodity for research.

> An even more bizarre concept has grown up: the notion of "collective dose." This is a calculational procedure that claims to predict health effects in a large population by adding up radiation doses that are individually negligible. NCRP-121 defines 1 mrem per year as "a negligible individual dose"--not harmless, mind you, but small enough "to be dismissed." Yet NCRP-121 hastens to add that even this small number is not trivial enough: "All doses should be included in calculations of collective dose; there is no conceptual basis for excluding any individual dose, however small." This is exactly the process by which people calculate that 30 000 people will die from Chernobyl. They multiply a trivial dose by 100 million people downwind and calculate a collective dose that predicts 30 000 deaths. 

> [Gunnar Walinder] describes a man sitting in a room full of risk evaluators and asking, with a twinkle in his eye, "Tell me: is it safe for me to get up out of this chair?" All of the risk experts but one assure him it is perfectly safe, that the exercise might even be good for him. "You'd have to have an awfully weak heart to be hurt by getting up out of a chair," they agree. But the nuclear risk expert objects strenuously: "I can in no way assure you that it is safe to get up. You might have a very weak heart."

> There are places on earth--in India, Iran, Brazil--where people have lived for countless generations in high natural radiation fields, 10 times and more above the U.S. average. The various indicators of health have been monitored in detail, comparing the health of people in these locations with the health of others whose radiation exposure is much less. There is no observable damage from the higher radiation exposure.

## From reddit comments

Maybe could be reframed as "not enough regulation." If NRC started upfront by setting clear thresholds for safety instead of leaving it to vague impressionistic goals, then ALARA wouldn't have come about.

> When I worked in engineering way back when, I knew some guys who spec'd out some instruments for a nuclear plant (in the US). They were appalled that they were required to spec out certain "approved" instruments (obsolete to the point they had been discontinued for some time and had to be special ordered at great cost) instead of much cheaper and more reliable modern instruments that had not been approved. I understand a lot of regulatory improvement has been made since (likely due to the complaints of such engineers), but at least at the time, these regulations were making nuclear plants objectively less safe.

Most of the cost of that japanese tidal wave was clean up cost of fukushima.

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-15288975): 0.1 micro [Sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert) per banana.
Eat a banana every day and be exposed to 36.5 micro Sievert per year. Compare this to the radiation exposure per year in various locations according to [this article](https://www.polity.org.za/article/is-johannesburg-the-most-radioactive-city-in-the-world-2021-02-16):
- Average annual exposure: 2.4 millisieverts per year
- Ramsar, Iran; 131 millisieverts
- Yangjiang: 6.4 millisieverts
- Kerala: 6 millisieverts
- Chernobyl Exclusion Zone today: 8.8 millisieverts

Upvoted comment incorrectly claims the banana diet gives you a higher dose. Units are important, people!

Prohibition on breeder reactors is mentioned in comments as an important regulatory barrier.
We have enough fuel sitting around to power the entire country for hundreds of years, but instead we turn it into bullets.
