# Notes on radiation, energy use and heat transfer.

## details of the hotplate

Imagine we have a magical griddle the same size and power as one you can buy for your countertop.

Let's say this griddle runs at 1500 watts and has an cooking surface of around 21 inches by 10 inches. This gives us a power output of about 

Magically, this hotplate always has the same power output, typically heating the surroundings, and the bottom doesn't absorb or transmit any heat.

## Equilibrium radiation.

Great. Magical cooking surface. How bright would this thing get if we stuck it in a vaccuum?

The Joules of radiation emitted from an object are given by 

$$\textcolor{black}{J_e} = \textcolor{brown}{M_e}+ \textcolor{red}{J_{e,r}} + \textcolor{green}{J_{e,tr}}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{Radiosity} = \textcolor{brown}{Radiant Emmitance}+ \textcolor{red}{Reflected Radiosity} + \textcolor{green}{Transmitted Radiosity}$$

If we make a few more assumptions:

- The hotplate is opaque, so $$\textcolor{green}{J_{e,tr}} = 0$$
- The hotplate doesn't have any other radiation sources shining on it, so $$\textcolor{red}{J_{e,r}} = 0$$
- The hotplate is a gray body, so that $$\textcolor{blue}{M_e}$$ is determined by the [Stefan Boltzmann Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law)

Then the above simiplifies to:

If we have an opaque diffuse gray body with no radiation shining on it, then Stefan-Boltzmann Law says:

$$\textcolor{black}{J_e} = \textcolor{goldenrod}{M_e} = \textcolor{blue}{\varepsilon} \textcolor{green}{\sigma}  \textcolor{red}{T^4}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{Radiosity} = \textcolor{goldenrod}{\text{Radiant Emittance}} = \textcolor{blue}{emissivity} \cdot \textcolor{green}{\text{Stefan's constant}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{\text{Temperature}^4}$$

Do a wee bit of alegebra, and we find that the temperature $\color{red} T$ needed to emit $\color{goldenrod} M_e$ watts per square meter of radiation is 

$$\textcolor{red}{T} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{\textcolor{goldenrod}{M_e}}{\textcolor{blue}{\varepsilon} \textcolor{green}{\sigma}}}$$

$$\textcolor{red}{\text{Temperature}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{\textcolor{goldenrod}{\text{Radiant Emittance}}}{\textcolor{blue}{\text{emissivity}}  \cdot \textcolor{green}{\text{Stefan's constant}}}}$$

Stefan's constant is $$\textcolor{green}{\sigma\approx\frac{5.670}{10^{8}}\frac{W}{m^{2}K^{4}}}$$, 
and the griddle is emitting $$\textcolor{goldenrod}{11000 \frac{W}{m^2}}$$ or energy. 
So then <span style="color:red">how hot</span> does our magical griddle need to get before it <span style="color:goldenrod">emits its entire power output</span> as radiation?

$$\textcolor{red}{T}=\sqrt[4]{\frac{11000}{\varepsilon \frac{5.670}{10^{8}}}}K = 100 \sqrt[4]{\frac{\textcolor{goldenrod}{11000}}{\varepsilon 5.670}}K$$

- If the object is a blackbody with $$\varepsilon = 1$$, then $$T \approx 670 K \approx 400 \degree C$$
- If the object is a graybody with emissivity [similar to stainless steel](https://www.thermoworks.com/emissivity-table) at $$\varepsilon = 0.59$$, then $$T \approx 760 K \approx 490 \degree C$$
- If the object is a graybody with emissivity similar to polished copper at $$\varepsilon = 0.05$$, then $$T \approx 1400 K \approx 1100 \degree C $$

Comparing that to the [information on this page about blacksmithing](https://www.giangrandi.org/optics/blackbody/blackbody.shtml), and various other [charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), our magical griddle could range anywhere from not visibly glowing to glowing orange hot, depending on the object's emmisivity properties.


### Interesting sidenote: weird cube made of gold and fish

A [Leslie cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_cube) is used to measure an objects emissivity.

- The cube is made of solid metal with a hollow interior.
- The inside is filled with hot water to make the whol thing some specific temperature
- The sides are coated with various materials. Originally:
    - Gold
    - silver
    - copper
    - isinglass, which is a natural glue made of dried fish swim bladder.

The emissivity of the metals is low and of the isinglue is high, so you can use that to calibrate a thermal camera and compare it to other objects' emissivities. 

Dutch has a leslie cube in orbit call FUNcube-1.
