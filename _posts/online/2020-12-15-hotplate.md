# Notes on radiation, energy use and heat transfer.

## details of the hotplate

Imagine we have a magical griddle the same size and power as one you can buy for your countertop.

Let's say this griddle runs at 1500 watts and has an cooking surface of around 21 inches by 10 inches. This gives us a power output of about 

Magically, this hotplate always has the same power output, typically heating the surroundings, and the bottom doesn't absorb or transmit any heat.

## Equilibrium radiation.

Great. Magical cooking surface. How bright would this thing get if we stuck it in a vaccuum?

The Joules of radiation emitted from an object are given by 

$$\textcolor{black}{J_e} = \textcolor{blue}{M_e}+ \textcolor{red}{J_{e,r}} + \textcolor{green}{J_{e,tr}}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{Radiosity} = \textcolor{blue}{Radiant Emmitance}+ \textcolor{red}{Reflected Radiosity} + \textcolor{green}{Transmitted Radiosity}$$
