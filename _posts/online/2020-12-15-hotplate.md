# Notes on radiation, energy use and heat transfer.

## details of the hotplate

Imagine we have a magical griddle the same size and power as one you can buy for your countertop.

Let's say this griddle runs at 1500 watts and has an cooking surface of around 21 inches by 10 inches. This gives us a power output of about 

Magically, this hotplate always has the same power output, typically heating the surroundings, and the bottom doesn't absorb or transmit any heat.

## Equilibrium radiation.

Great. Magical cooking surface. How bright would this thing get if we stuck it in a vaccuum?

The Joules of radiation emitted from an object are given by 

$$\textcolor{black}{J_e} = \textcolor{brown}{M_e}+ \textcolor{red}{J_{e,r}} + \textcolor{green}{J_{e,tr}}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{Radiosity} = \textcolor{brown}{Radiant Emmitance}+ \textcolor{red}{Reflected Radiosity} + \textcolor{green}{Transmitted Radiosity}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{ðŸ”†} = \textcolor{brown}{ðŸ’¡}+ \textcolor{red}{ðŸªž} + \textcolor{green}{ðŸªŸ}$$

If we make a few more assumptions:

- The hotplate is opaque, so $$\textcolor{green}{J_{e,tr}} = 0$$
- The hotplate doesn't have any other radiation sources shining on it, so $$\textcolor{red}{J_{e,r}} = 0$$
- The hotplate is a gray body, so that $$\textcolor{blue}{M_e}$$ is determined by the [Stefan Boltzmann Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law)

Then the above simiplifies to:

If we have an opaque diffuse gray body with no radiation shining on it, then Stefan-Boltzmann Law says:

$$\textcolor{black}{J_e} = \textcolor{brown}{M_e} = \textcolor{blue}{\varepsilon} \textcolor{green}{\sigma}  \textcolor{red}{T^4}$$

$$\textcolor{black}{Radiosity} = \textcolor{brown}{Radiant Emmitance} = \textcolor{blue}{emissivity} \cdot \textcolor{green}{Stefan's constant} \cdot \textcolor{red}{Temperature^4}$$

Do a wee bit of alegebra, and we find that the temperature $T$ needed to emit $M_e$ watts per square meter of radiation is 

$$T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{M_{e}}{\varepsilon\sigma}}$$

$$\textcolor{red}{Temperature} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{\textcolor{brown}{M_e}}{\textcolor{blue}{\varepsilon} \textcolor{green}{\sigma}}}
