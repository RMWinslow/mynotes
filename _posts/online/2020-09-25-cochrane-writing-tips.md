Writing Tips for Ph. D. Students  
John H. Cochrane  
Published June 8, 2005

### Get a web page.  

If your paper is ready for a faculty member
to read it, it should be on your webpage. Put the date on the paper so people know if they are reading a new version.

# Organization

- Write down *one*  central and novel contribution of your paper. Write this down in one
paragraph. 
  - As with all your writing, this must be concrete. 
  -  Explain what the central results *are*. 
  -  Your readers are impatient.
-  Organize the paper in "triangular" or "newspaper" style, not in "joke" or "novel" style. 
   -  (Give a paper talk not a TED talk)
   -  Start with the most important part, then fill in the background.
   -  put the punchline at the start the slowly explain the joke
   -  don't put the punchline in table 12
-  A good paper is not a travelogue of your search process.

### triangular style writing

Front-load everything with the juicy bits.

Start your article with the important contributions. Start your paragraphs with the main point. Start headings with the sexiest words.

Make your point, *then* explain it.

I should probably focus on doing this more when teaching as well.

## Abstract

- Most journals allow 100-150 words. Obey this limit now. 
- The main function of the abstract is to communicate the *one* central and novel contribution, which you just figured out. 
- You should not mention other literature in the abstract.

## Introduction

- Start with what *you do* in the paper.
  - Explain your contribution
  - Do not start with philosophy
  - Do not start with saying that other people are interested
  - Do not start with long motivation about public policy
  - start with your central contribution
- Roadmap parahraph is optional.

## Literature Review

Don't start with a page and a half of other literature.

You can do that after explaining your contribution. Make it a seperate section so it's easy to skip.

Be generous in your citations.

But literature reviews have gotten way out of hand. 
Just set your paper against the two or three closest current papers.
Make sure everyone gets credit for ideas that might otherwise seem like yours.

## Body of the paper

Get to the central result as fast as possible.

Here’s the rule: 
*There should be nothing before the main result that a reader does not need to know in order to understand the main result.*

## Theory

> In most papers, the “main result” is empirical. The theory is there to help understand the empirical work. Following the rule, then, the theory must be the minimum required for the reader to understand the empirical results.

## Empirical Work

Start with the main result.   
Do not do :   
- warmup exercises,
- extensive data description
- preliminary estimates, 
- replication of others’ work

All of this can come in the appendix.

After the main result, put in graphs and tables that give intution, robustness, responses to criticism, etc. But again: appendix.

## Conclusion

Shouldn't be necessary. Put it in for readers who skip to the end.

Short and sweet.

Maybe a short paragraph or two acknowleding limitations and suggest implications.
Keep it short though -- don't write your grant application here.

> And don’t speculate; the reader wants to know your facts not your opinions.

## Appendices

Insightful comments on the literature, more general versions of the model, all your robustness exercises? Dump in in the appendix. Maybe dump them out of the appendix too.

Lol. "Bond Risk premia" by Cochrane and Piazzesi: 
The [paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~piazzesi/cp.pdf) is 23 pages. 
The [appendix](https://web.stanford.edu/~piazzesi/cpapp.pdf) is 31 pages. 







# Writing

## Keep it short

Every word counts. 40 pages at the max. Drafts should be shorter. Shorter is better.

Don't repeat things. "In other words" is a sign of trouble. (But I like using examples about grandma. :sad: )

> Follow the rule *“first describe what you do, then explain it, compare it to alternatives, and compare it to others’ procedures”* at the micro level as well as the macro level. 
> For example, in describing a data transformation, just start with, say, “I adjust income by the square root of household size”. Then tell us why adjusting is important, and then talk about different adjustment functions. Most writers do all this in the reverse order.

Previews and recalls are a sign of poor organization (I did that a lot when teaching. Is that a bad sign? Or good taking into account spaced repitition?)

Strive for precision. 

Document your work.

Simple is better. The less math used, the better. The simpler the estimation
technique, the better.

(This paper is following that tringular structure thing for paragraphs.)

## Footnotes

Don't use footnotes for parenthetical comments. If it's important, put it in the text.

Use footnotes for things the typical reader can skip, but a few might want:  
- long lists of references
- wee bits of algebra
- other documentation

## Tables

Should be self contained. 
The reader shouldn't have to search around to understand the definitions of greek letters.

Labels should help with skimming readers. They're not for documentation.

Regression tabels should have the equation

All numbers should be discussed in the text.

Use the correct number of sigfigs and use sensible units. 



##  Writing tips.

> The reader usually wants most of all to understand your basic point, and won’t start
criticizing it before he or she understands it. That’s behind my advice to first state and
explain what you do, and save defending it and comparing it to other approaches until much
later.

Active tense. Present tense. Singular I on sole-authored papers. You can use "we" when including the reader. Take responsibility for what you're writing.

Avoid jargon when possible ( cochrane suggests agents -> people ). "Use", not "utilize". 

concrete examples

Obnoxious fragments:
- “It should be noted that”
- "It is usually the case that"
- “It is easy to show that” means that it isn’t
- “A comment is in order at this point.”
- "illustrative"
  - “illustrative test”
  -  “illustrative empirical work.”
  -  Do real empirical work or don’t do any at all. (Uh oh)

I disagree with his point about hyphens. I like the computer-science-aesthetic of joining the component words of a compound into a single unit. And we're not allowed to use camelCase or underscored_phrases in formal writing, so unorthodox-dashes-between-words has to do. 
But find. The JFE says not to.

Define greek letters in an easy to find place and give them a name. 

> Strike “I leave x for future research.” We’re less interested in your plans and excuses than we are in your memoirs.

#### On assumptions in models:  
> You don’t need to “assume” things about a model. Don’t write “I assume that consumers
have power utility” (And, of course, don’t write “it is assumed that utility is power,” right?)
You are describing a model, not reality, so you can just state the model structure. “Con-
sumers have power utility.” (“In this model” is understood.) Save “assumptions” for things
that really do modify the real world, “I assume there are no shifts in the demand curve so
that the regression of price on quantity identifies the supply curve.”

Don’t start your paper with a cute quotation. (But Cochrane, I like cute quotations.)

Every sentence should have a subject, a verb, and an object.




# Tips for empirical work. 

> These tips verge on “how to do empirical work” rather than just “how to write empirical
work,” but in the larger picture “doing” and “writing” are not that different.

It's probably worth coming back to this section and making a big checklist. There's a long list of empirical questions here. 

Give stylized facts. [Fama and French 1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb05202.x) as an example.




# Seminar presentations

Time flies. And you can't skim in a seminar.

Don't need literature review or motivation in a seminar.
Just get to the point. 

> Gene Fama usually starts his seminars with “Look at table 1.”

Don't include bullet points for every word you will say. 
Equations, tables, graphs -- things the audience needs to *see*.

People don't remember equations, so too much fluff, and they can't hold it in their heads.

Also, people need more than one minute to digest the slides.

As in writing the paper, your main objective is to get to the #1 important contribution
as fast as possible. Don't start with pointless motivation or policy implications before we even know the result.

>  I timed the finance workshop last winter quarter and not one paper
got to the main results in under an hour!


# Conclusion

> May economists falsely think of themselves as scientists who just “write up” research. We
are not; we are primarily writers. Economics and finance papers are essays. Most good
economists spend at least 50% of the time they put into any project on writing. For me, it’s
more like 80%.
Pay attention to the writing in papers you read, and notice the style adopted by authors
you admire.
