Just read [this artcile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/11/15/no-hurricanes-are-not-bigger-stronger-and-more-dangerous/?sh=7ae104374d9e) with specifci complaints about historic hurricane intensity.
Complains about using economic losses to impute climate variables.

Fits with a pattern I've seen where news article and social media makes claims like "it's scientific consensus that climate change is causing worsening hurricanes".
But I've read the IPCC report from 2014, and it says 

> There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical
cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the
attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it
is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in
the North Atlantic since 1970.

Supposedly, hurricane data is pretty sparse, and the measuresment aren't great.

[Here's a page about NOAA cyclone measurement.](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html). Historical data gets adjusted a lot.

Here's a [random commenter](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-march#comment-1407569) saying that [tide gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_gauge) 
go janky in large storms.

To read: This [blagpost](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/a-remarkable-decline-in-landfalling) seems like it has some interesting links


Also TODO: [This article](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-biden-administration-just-failed) about carbon pricing has some interesting historical court decisions.
