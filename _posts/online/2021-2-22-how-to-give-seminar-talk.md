Your Audience does not care about your topic.
You have 2 minutes to change their minds.

Assume the audience is about to leave.
Make sure they walk out with something.


- State a question
    - Policy counterfactual
    - estimate of important parameter
    - test of important prediction

Your question should be motivated by *economics*, not *economics literature*.


Slides should be clear and sparse. No extra detail.
