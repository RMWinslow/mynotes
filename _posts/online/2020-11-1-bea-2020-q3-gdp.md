## Key nuggets

### GDP Components

GDP bounced back hard after Q2 plummet. 

![](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/Quarter%20to%20Quarter%20Change%20in%20Real%20GDP%20Oct29.PNG)

Consumption and Investment went up. Gov went down. Xports went up, but Mports went way up so Net Xports fell.
Real Seasonally adjusted goods exports went up 104.5 annual percentage points, and '' goods imports 107.9.
Also huge increases in durable good consumption, residential investment (but not structures).
National Defense is only gov spending that grew in Q3

Service consumption up from last quarter but down from last year's Q3. Good consumption up both compared to Q2 and 2019 Q3. Wowza. 
Residential investment, Gov spending, and Personal Disposable Income are also up from last year.

- Nominal GDP -32.8% in Q2, +38%
- Real GDP was 7.4% bigger in Q3 than Q2, equivalent in speed to a 33.1% annual growth rate
- But growth not same in every component. Of that growth, components contributed: 
  - Consumption: +25.27 points, +76% of growth
    - Goods: +9.24 points, +27% of GDP growth
      - Big increases from motor vehicles and clothing
    - Services +16.04 points, +48% of GDP growth
      - Healthcare: +7.61 points, +23% of GDP growth. And Q2 had drop in health services. Looks like a lot of people were just putting off doctor's appointments.
      - Also big jump from food and recreation services
      - Nonprofits fell quite a bit though. I guess less necessary.
  - Investment: +11.58 points, 35% of GDP growth
    - Fixed Investment (capital): +4.96 points, +15% of GDP growth
      - Big jumps in structures, transport equipment, and Computers
      - IP stuff like software, research, and art has not bounced back.
    - Inventories: +6.62 points, +20% of GDP growth 
      - Not in table, but BEA says that biggest chunk was increase in car dealership inventories
  - Gov: -0.68 points, -2% of GDP growth
    - Federal expenditures jumped up in Q2 and then fell in Q3. State and local dropped in both Q2 and Q3
  - Net Exports -3.09 points, -9.3% of GDP growth
    - Exports: +4.90 points, +15% of GDP growth
    - Imports: -7.99 points, -24% of GDP growth (imports went up)
    - Mostly exporting loads of goods and services. I guess people aren't travelling much to sell stuff? I would naively expect that service exports would do better during pandemic, bc copmuter service not risky like in-person service.



  
### Price Indices

- GDP deflator -1.4% in Q2, +3.4% in Q3
- PCE deflator -1.6% in Q2, +3.4% in Q3
- Food prices -1.8% in Q3
- Energy prices +27.8% in Q3
- PCE deflator, excluding food and energy -0.8% in Q2, +3.2% in Q3
  

### National Savings, etc.

Personal Income and savings fell because of end of pandemic transfer programs:

- Nominal personal income +1.45 trillion in Q2, -.5406 trillion in Q3. More than accounted for by decrease in transfers. But increase in compensation and profits.
- Disposable Personal Income +1.60 trillion Q2, -.6367 trillion in Q3.
  - Real DPI +46.6% then -16.3%
- Personal Savings 4.71 trillion in Q2, 2.78 trillion in Q3
- Personal Savings Rate: 25.7% Q2, 15.8% Q3


Concepts for teaching:
- Real shocks
- consumption smoothing


## Personal Income and Covid Programs

[From here](https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/effects-of-selected-federal-pandemic-response-programs-on-personal-income-2020q3-adv.pdf)

- compensation dipped down but is recovering
- Proprieter's income are higher than before.
  - Farm profits bigly supplemented by *CoV Food Assistance Program*
  - Paycheck protextion program loans also look pretty beefy.
- Income reciepts on assts dipped a bit in Q3
- Transfers went way up in Q2 then dipped down.
  - Medicare as a whole the same, but medicare reimbursement went up.
  - Unemployment insurance ***exploded*** in Q2, and has shrunk back down but is still crazy high in Q3
  - Also a big chunk of "Economic impact payments" in Q2 from CARES act.
  - Something called  *provider relief fund*, gives money to health providers impacted by the virus.

Savings were really high in Q2 because of the spike in transfers combined with reduction in C. Savings way down in Q3 but still higher than before.
