Student debt forgiveness is a policy position that has got a lot of buzz recently. 
Joe Biden [has promised to give up to $10,000 to anyone with student debt.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/student-loan-forgiveness-could-be-more-likely-but-challenges-remain-.html)
And other politicians have urged him to give as much as $50,000 per person.

While browsing reddit's front page recently, I came across this tweet on the subreddit "r murderedbyAOC":

> tweet goes heres

The format of twitter forces people to condense complex arguments down into simplistic hot takes, so I don't want this to be read as a "dunking on" this particular politician.

But what's a reddit post if the take isn't at least a little bit spicy? So instead of just arguing against student debt forgiveness in the abstract, 
I'll try to frame this as an argument that "I got screwed and so should you" is a sensible argument when applied to the context of *student* debt.

### What is fairness?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg

instinct for progressive redistribution









### The regressive structure of student loan forgiveness

The notion that the policy is "*unfair*" is just the instinctual, layman version of a more sophisticated argument: 
Student loan forgiveness is a regressive redistribution of wealth.
It, at least in aggregate, gives to the *haves* instead of the *have nots*.

Goofus and Gallant type thing

And the data bears out this narrative.

At least 10 Jeffs Bezos. Give a million dollars to each of them, and fund it by taxing Elon Musk





### Moral Hazard



And that's not even getting into worries about the implementation of such a policy nor the possible 
distortionary effects it could have on students' decisions to take on debt in the future. 
(ie If the gov pays off student debt once, will future students then take on more debt than they otherwise would, rationally anticipating it will be cancelled?)
I just wanted to focus on how "fairness" really is a sensible argument here.


It's not wicked to give people money. (The ol' welfare theorems say that markets *+ transfers* are the path to heaven). 
But it is wicked to make that gift conditional on the recipient making bad decisions.









## What about medical debt?

Health economics isn't something I know much about, but on the surface, medical debt forgiveness seems a lot more sensible.
It's still an expensive transfer, and I doubt it's anywhere close to the optimal policy, but:
- Perverse incentives are lessened because while people may choose to smoke, they don't choose to get cancer, if you get what I mean.
- The illnesses you get have less of a connection to your education than the career you get does.

On the other hand, the argument about consumption and leisure still applies, so maybe it would be better yet to just give a lump sum transfer to everyone who has ever had cancer. 

(Sidenote: Is there any country with a public health insurance program which just pays for all of a household's medical expenditure above X% of their annual income?
Like some sort of 




## Better policies to help allieviate the burden of student loans

It is of course true that not all college graduates benefit from the college wage premium. (See the text of the FRED blogpost linked in section II).
And that many people are burdened by debts for degrees which they never completed.
It's important not just to consider the aggregate, but also the individual. All the interesting stuff happens on the margins, after all.

So is there a way we can help those burdened by student debt without enacting a "Give Money to Bezos" style policy? Absolutely.



### Bankruptcy Amendment.

As it currently stands in the US, student loans are counted among the [exceptions to discharge under Chapter 7 bankrupcty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523).
This section prevents bankruptcy from cancelling out debt related to things like child support, fraud, or recent taxes.
It also applies to student loan debt unless such debt imposes an "undue hardship":

> A discharge under section 727... does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt — ... 
unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents, for —
an educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit, or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution; or
an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholarship, or stipend; or
any other educational loan that is a qualified education loan, as defined in section 221(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, incurred by a debtor who is an individual;

This "undue hardship" caveat may be reasonable in intention. 
But in practice, it's loosely defined, and proving undue hardship is a legal barrier which [prevents most student loan debtors from even trying to discharge this debt.](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/22/797330613/myth-busted-turns-out-bankruptcy-can-wipe-out-student-loan-debt-after-all)
The above article mentions that only [0.1 percent of student loan debtors who have filed for bankruptcy attempt to discharge their student loans](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1894445).

<!--Recent court case argued exemption doesn't apply to certain private loans. https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2020/09/02/court-allows-bankruptcy-discharge-of-200000-in-student-loans/?sh=657b0b234fd9-->

One potential remedy is [H.R.2648, the Student Borrower Bankruptcy Relief Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2648/text), 
which simply gets rid of the above exception for student loans. 
(There's something aesthetically pleasing about a bill whose title is almost as long as its actual content.)
