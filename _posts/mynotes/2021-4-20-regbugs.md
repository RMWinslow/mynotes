Examples of well meaning policies interacting in unforeseen ways to cause bad outcomes.

- Texas power outage 2021. Company offers cheap wholesale power. Gov sets high price on power to encourage production. INdividually both nice things. Together led to some bankruptcies.
- NRC paid by the hour for inspections
- Covid testing early 2020: hospitals have testing equipment. But cant use it for serious conditions. After Covid declared a serious epidemic, hostpitals are no longer allowed to test for it.
