If you trace a coastline from a accurate copyrighted map , does your tracing  constitute a derivative work of the original map?

Maps themselves are explictly copyrightable objects under US law.
But facts themselves are not copyrightable. 
It is the creative expression of those facts that is.

[Feist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.) found that copying data from an alphabetical phone book could not consitute copyright infringement because that data, presented in the obvious order did not constitute a creative act. 
Even the existence of phony entries didn't constitute enough creativity to protect the phone book's entries. 
If it did, after all, that would essentially make reference sources impossible to legally use.

Another case is [Trivial Pursuit and Fred Worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit#Fred_Worth_lawsuit).
Trivial Pursuit used Worth's books as a source for trivia, including facts he made up.

According to [this page on fictitious entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry):

> In Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.,[31] a New York corporation which published and sold Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide sued Hagstrom Map Corporation for publishing and selling New York City Taxi & Limousine Drivers Guide, alleging violation of the Copyright Act of 1976. A United States Federal Court found that Nester's selection of addresses involved a sufficient level of creativity to be eligible for copyright and enjoined Hagstrom from copying that portion of the guide. However, the court also found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "trap street") are not themselves protected by copyright.

> In Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps, Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the Copyright Act of 1976 by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co. as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."

From the Hagstrom case:

> to treat 'false' facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright ... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated

And according to [this page on trap streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street).

[This page says that](http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/public-domain-maps.html): 

> If the components of the map are “entirely obvious” the map will not be copyrightable. For example, an outline map of the state of Texas, or one of the US showing the state boundaries is not copyrightable. (Not creative.) Ditto maps that use standard cartographic conventions, like a survey map. (Not original.)  
> This is could be a tough call in certain cases (I mean, come on ... “entirely obvious”?) but that's the what the courts have said. Just keep in mind ... what you think is entirely obvious, the mapmaker might contest as creative.


And 

> Not every part of a map can be protected by copyright. If some parts of a map are in the public domain, you may use them freely.  
> What parts can you use without permission? ...  
> Geographic or topographic features. Those are facts, and facts aren't copyrightable...  
> Stuff copied from other maps (say, from a public domain USGS map). Whatever new information the mapmaker added will be protected by copyright (the selection, arrangement of the info), but the stuff that was copied (the elements of a USGS map used as a starting point, for example) will stay in the public domain.

Openstreetmaps seems much more concerned about the copyright of map data.

Are they just covering their butts?
