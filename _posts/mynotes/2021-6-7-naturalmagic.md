[Magia Naturalis](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Phil%20281b/Philosophy%20of%20Magic/Natural_Magic/jportat2.html) is a book from 1558, and translated into English translated into English in 1658 under the title Natural Magick. It's about, well, "natural magic". I'll let the author explain what that means: 

> Tully, in his book of Divination, says, that in the Persian language, a Magician is nothing else but one that expounds and studies divine things; and it is the general name of wise-men in that country.

> So then Magick is taken amongst all men for wisdom, and the perfect knowledge of natural things: and those are called Magicians, whom the Latin's call Wisemen, the Greeks call Philosophers, of Pythagoras only, the first of that name, as Diogenes writes; "the Indians call them Brackmans (Brahmans), in their own tongue; but in Greek they call them Gymnosophists, as much to say as naked Philosophers;" The Babylonians and Assyrians call them Chaldeans, of Chaldea a country in Asia; The Celts in France call them Druids, Bards, and Semnothites; The Egyptians call them priests; and the Cabalists call them prophets. And so in diverse countries Magick has diverse names.

> There are two sorts of Magick; the one is infamous, and unhappy, because it has to do with foul Spirits, and consists of incantations and wicked curiosity; and this is called Sorcery; an art which all learned and good men detest; neither is it able to yield an truth of reason or nature, but stands merely upon fancies and imaginations, such as vanish presently away, and leave nothing behind them; ... The other Magick is natural; which all excellent wise men do admit and embrace, and worship with great applause; neither is there any thing more highly esteemed, or better thought of, by men of learning. 

> Magick is nothing else but the survey of the whole course of Nature. For, while we consider heavens, the stars, the Elements, how they are moved, and how they are changed, by this means we find out the hidden secrets of living creatures, of plants, of metals, and of their generation and corruption; so that this whole Science seems merely to depend upon the view of Nature, as later we will see more at large.

> Seeing Magick, as we showed before, as a practical part of natural Philosophy, it behooves a Magician, and one that aspires to the dignity of the profession, to be an exact and very perfect Philosopher.

> The Physicians hold that all things consist of four qualities, heat, cold, moisture, drought, and of their predominance when they meet together.

> There are certain secondary qualities, which attend as it were upon the first; and these are said to work in a second sort; as to soften, to ripen, to resolve, to make less or thinner; as when heat works into any mixed body, it brings out that which is unpure, and so while it strives to make it fit for his purpose that it may be more simple, the body becomes thereby smaller and thinner. So cold does preserve, bind, and congeal; drought does thicken or harden, and makes uneven; for when there is great store of moisture in the outer parts, that which the drought is not able to consume, it hardens, and the outer parts become rugged; for that part where the moisture is gone, sinking down, and the other where it is hardened, rising up, there must needs be great roughness and ruggedness. So moisture does augment, corrupt, and for the most part works on thing by itself, and another by some accident; as by ripening, binding, expelling, and such like, it brings forth Milk, Urine, monthly flowers, and sweat; which Physicians call the third qualities, that do so wait upon the second, as the second upon the first.

>  Jupiter, that is to say fire; Pluto, that is to say, Earth; Juno, that is to say air; and Nestis, that is to say, water. 

> Yes, even in Heaven itself, as Jupiter and Venus love all Planets save Mars and Saturn, Venus agrees with Mars, where no other plant agrees with him.

> thinness, thickness, roughness, smoothness, easiness to be cleft

>   Ivy, as it is the bane of all trees, so it is most hurtful, and the greatest enemy to the Vine.  And therefore Ivy also is good against Drunkenness. 

> Hither belongs that notable disagreement that is between Garlic and Loadstone. For being smeared about with Garlic, it will not draw Iron to it, as Plutark has noted, and after him Ptolomaus; ThLoadstonene has in it a poisonous  Virtue, and Garlic is good against poison. But if no man had written of the power of Garlic against the Loadstone, yet we might conjecture it to be so, because it is good against the Viper, and mad Dogs and poisonous waters. 

> The Sun is the Governor of time, and the rule of life. Hence, Jamblicus following the doctrine of the Egyptians, says, that every good thing comes certainly from the power of the Sun, and if we receive any good from any thing else, yet the Sun must perfect and finish it. Heraclitus, calls the Sun, the Fountain of heavenly light; Opheus calls it the light of life, Plato calls it heavenly fire, an everliving creature, a star that has a soul, the greatest and the daily star. And the natural Philosophers call it the very heart of Heaven. And Plotinus shows, that in ancient times the Sun was honored instead of God. Neither yet is the Moon less powerful, but what with her own force, and what with the force of the Sun which she borrows, she works much, by reason of her nearness to these inferiors. Albumasar said, that all things had their Virtue from the Sun and the Moon. And Hermes the learned, said, that the Sun and the Moon are the life of all things living.

> In like manner, Cucumbers, Gourds, Pompons, and such like, as have the store of waterish juice, feel the state of the Moon. For they wax as she does, and when she wains, they waste,

> So also, when the Moon passes through the signs of the Zodiac which are most peculiar to the Earth, if you then plant trees, they will be strongly rooted in the Earth. If you plant them when she passes through the signs of the air, then the tree so planted, will be plentiful in branches and leaves, and increases more upward then downward. But of all other, the most pregnant sign hereof is found in the Pomegranate. Which will bring forth fruit juice so many years, as many days as the Moon is old when you plant it. And it is a report also, that Garlic, if it will lose its strong flavor. All cut and lopped woods, as timber and fuel, are of much moisture at the new of the Moon; and by reason of that moisture, they wax soft, and so the worm eats them and they wither away.

>  So they report that there is a Moon-herb, having round twirled leaves of a bluish color, which is well acquainted with the age of the Moon, for when the Moon waxes, this Herb every day of her age brings forth a leaf; and when she wanes, the same Herb loses for every day a leaf. These variable effects of the Moon, we may see more at large, and more usually in tame creatures and in plants, here we have daily fight and experience thereof. 

> If we cut our hair, or pare our nails before the new Moon, they will grow again but slowly. If at or about the new Moon, they will grow again quickly.

> Onions alone, of all other Herbs, (which is most wonderful) feels the changeable state of the planets, but quite contrary to their change frameth itself, for the when the Moon wanes, the Onions increase, and when she waxes, they decay. For which cause the priests of Egypt would not eat Onions, as Plutark writes in his fourth commentary upon the Hesiode. That kind of Spurge which is called Heliofeopium, because it follows the Sun, disposes of her leaves as the Sun rules them, for when the Sun rises, she opens them, as being desirous that the morning should see them rise, and shuts them when the Sun sets, as desiring to have her flower covered and concealed from the night. So many other Herbs follow the Sun, as the Herb Turnsole

Ah yes, the fundamental forces of the world: magnetism, electricity, flammability, heliotropism, and gravity.

> The concavity or hollowness of the sphere of the Moon, draws up fire to it, because of the affinity of their natures, and the sphere of the fire likewise draws up air, and the center of the world draws the Earth downward, and the natural place of the waters draws the waters to it. *Hence it is that the Loadstone draws Iron to it, Amber draws Chaff or light straws, Brimstone draws fire, the Sun draws after it many flowers and leaves, and the Moon draws after it the waters.* Plotinus and Synefius say, "Great is nature everywhere, she lays certain baits whereby to catch certain things in all places. As she draws down heavy things by the center of the Earth, as by a bait, so she draws light things upward by the concavity of the Moon. By heat, leaves, by moisture, roots, by one bait or another, all things."

> Nay, he lays earthly things under heavenly things, and inferiors so fitly for their superiors everywhere to work upon, as if a man should lay Iron before the Loadstone to be drawn to it, or Crystal before the Sun to be enlightened by it, or an Egg under a Henhen to hatch it. Furthermore, as some can so cherish Eggs, that even without the help of living creatures, they will make them live, yes and oftentimes they will prepare such matter, so cunningly, that even without Eggs, or any apparent seeds, they will bring forth living creatures, (as they will bring forth Bees, of an Ox, and a Scorpion, of Basil;) working together by the help of universal nature upon the vantage of fit matter, and a seasonable or convenient time. 

> Likewise he learns of living creatures, which though they have no understanding, yet their senses are far quicker then ours, and by their actions they teach us Physic, Husbandry, the art of building, the disposing of household affairs, and almost all arts and Sciences. 

> Some Herbs are good for procreation of a male, and some of a female, as the Herb which is called Marisica, and Foeminipara, both are like each other. The fruit of the Foeminipara is like the moss of an Olive tree, the fruit of the Maripara is double like a man's Stones. The fruit of White Ivy will make feed barren, but the fruit of Arsemery will make it fertile, which fruit is a small grain, like to Millet. The leaves of the Herb Harts-tongue will make a man quite barren, if the Herb itself be barren, for there is Harts-tongue that bears fruit, and this will make a man fruitful. It is a thing to be noted in a Bur, that a flower grows within the roughness and prickles of it, which does not show itself, but conceives and brings forth feed within itself, much like as Weasels and Vipers do. For they bring forth Eggs within themselves, and soon after bring forth young ones, so the Bur contains, and cherishes, and ripens the flower within itself, and afterward yields fruit.

>  As for example, fire being very active, does more easily convert things into itself, and so water into water.  Avicenna says, that if any thing stand long in Salt, it will become wholly Salt, if in an unsavory vessel, it will become unsavory. He that converses with a bold man, shall be bold, if with a fearful man, he shall be fearful. And look what living creature converses among men, the same will be tame and gentle. Such positions are usual in Physic, as, all parts of the body, are nourished by their like, the brain by brains, teeth by teeth, lights by lights, and the liver by the liver.

> Again, we must well consider, what kinds of qualities are incident to what kinds of parties, as, commonly queens are impudent, ruffians, are luxurious, thieves are fearful, and such like passions, as writers everywhere mention. Moreover, some natural things have not only such properties in themselves, but they are apt also to communicate them unto others. A Harlot is not only impudent in herself, but she also naturally infects therewith, all that she touches and carries about her, so that if a man does often behold himself in her glass, or put on her garments, it will make him as impudent and lecherous as she is. The Loadstone does not only draw to itself that Iron which it touches, but also all Iron things near it, the same ring which the Loadstone draws to itself, will draw many rings if they be near, so that it will be like a chain, the Virtue of the Loadstone passing out of one ring into another. And the like may be observed in other things. We must note also, that the Virtues of some things are feared in whole substance, of other things, in some of their parts. The Sea-Lamprey stops a ship, not principally with any one part, but with her whole body. And there be many like examples. On the other side, many things work by some of their parts, as the Cockatrice and the Basilisk, by their eyes. Likewise Pismires shun the wings of a Rere-mouse, but her head and heart they do not shun. So they shun the heart of an Houpe, but neither the head, nor yet the wings. The like may be observed in other things.

> Flowers must be gathered in the spring, because then they have most Virtues And leaves must be gathered in the summer.

> Hot and slender Herbs should be gathered when Mars and the Sun are lords of the celestial houses, moist Herbs, when the Moon is lord, but you must take heed that you gather them not in the falling houses thereof. These things well observed in gathering plants, will make them very profitable for physical uses.

> Zama is a city in Africa, Ismuc is a town twenty miles from it. And whereas all Africa besides, is a great breeder of beasts, especially of Serpents, and that town there breed none at all, nay, if any be brought thither, it dies. And the Earth of that place also kills beasts, wherever it is carried. In the great Tarquine Lake of Italy, are seen trees, some round, some triangle, as the wind move them, but now four square. In the Country beyond the River Po, that part which is called Monsterax, there is a kind of Corn called Siligo, which being thrice sown, makes good bread-corn. Near to Harpasum a town of Asia, there is a huge rock, which if you touch with one finger, will move, if with your whole body, it will not move. There are some place of the Earth that are full of great fires, as Aetna in Sicily, the Hill Chimaera in Phaselis, the fire whereof Ctefias writes, will be kindled with water, and quenched with Earth. And in the country of Megalopolis, and the fields about Arcia, a coal falling on the Earth, sets it on fire. So in Lycia, the hills Ephesti being touched with a torch, flame out, in so much that the stones and sands there do burn in the waters, wherein if a man make a gutter with a staff, he shall see rivers of the fire run therein. 

> There are also many kinds of water, and they have diverse properties. The river Himera in Sicily, is divided into two parts. That which runs against Aetna, is very sweet, that which runs through the Salt vein, is very Salt. In Cappadocia, between the cities Mazaca, and Tuava, there is a lake, where into if you put Reeds or timber, they become stones by little and little, and are not changed from stones again, never can anything in that water be ever changed. In Hierapolis, beyond the River Maeander, there is a water that becomes gravel, so that they which make water-courses, raise up whole banks thereof. The rivers Cephises and Melas in Boeotia, if cattle drink of them, as they do continually to make them conceive, through the dams be white, yet their young shall be russet, or dun, or coal-black. So the Sheep that drink of the River Peneus in Thessaly, and Astax in Pontus, are thereby made black. Some kinds of waters also are deadly, which from the poisonous juice of the Earth become poisonous, as the well of Terracina called Neptunius, which kills as many as drink of it, and therefore in old times it was stopped up. And the lake Cychros, in Thracia, kills all that drink of it, and all that wash themselves with it. In Nonacris, a country of Arcady, there flow very cold waters out of a stone, which are called the Water of Styx, which break to pieces all vessels of Silver and Brass, and nothing can hold them but a Mule's foot, wherein it was brought from Antipater, into the country where Alexander was, and there his son Folla killed the King with it. In the country about Flascon, the way to Campania, in the field Cornetum, there is a lake with a well in it, wherein seem to like the bones of Snakes, Lizards, and other Serpents, but when you would take them out, there is no such thing. So there are some sharp and sour veins of water, as Lyncesto, and Theano in Italy, which I sought out very diligently, and found it by the way to Rome, a mile from Theano, and it is exceeding good against the Stone. There is a well in Paphlagonia, whosoever drinks of it, is presently drunken. In Chios is a well, that makes all that drink of it, sottish and senseless. In Sufa is a well, who so drinks of it, looses his teeth. The water of Niles is so fertile, that it makes the clods of Earth to become living creatures. In Ethiopia is a well, which is so cold at noon, that you cannot drink it, and so hot at midnight, that you cannot touch it. There are many other like wells, which Ovid speaks of. Ammo's well is cold all day, and warm both morning and evening. The water of Athamas, set wood on fire, at the mall of the Moon . There is a well where the Chicanos inhabit, that turns into stones all that touches it, or drinks of it. Crates and Sybarites make hair show like Amber and Gold, the water of Salami, and the Ethiopian lakes, make them mad or in a trance that drink of it, he that drinks of the well Clitoris, never cares for wine after, the River Lyncestious makes men drunken, the Lake Phones in Arcady, is hurtful if you drink it by night, if by day, it is wholesome.

> The Herb Dragon-wort, both the greater and smaller, have a stalk full of sundry-colored specks any man eat their root, or rub his hands with their leaves, the Viper cannot hurt him. The Dragon-fish being cut and opened, and laid to the place which he has stung, is a present remedy against his sting, as Aetius writes. The Viper itself, if you flay her, and strip off her skin, cut off her head and tail, cast away all her entrails, boil her like an Eel, and give her to one that she has bitten, to eat, it will cure him. Or if you cut off her head being alive and lay the part next the neck, while it is hot, upon the place which she has bitten, it will strangely draw out the Poison.


> Diodorus says, that near to the city Thebais in Egypt, when Nilus overflowing is past, the Sun heating the wet ground, the chaps of the earth send forth great store of Mice in many places, which astonishes men to see, that the fore-part of the mice should live and be moved, whereas their hinder parts are not yet shaped. Pliny says, that after the swaging of Nilus, there are found little Mice begun to be made of earth and water, their fore-parts living, and their hinder parts being nothing but earth. Aelianus says, that a little rain in Egypt, engenders many Mice , which being scattered everywhere in their fields, eat down their Corn, and devour it. And so it is in Pontus, but by their prayers to God, they are consumed. Macrobious and Avicenna say, that the Mice so generated, do increase exceedingly by coupling together. Aristotle found out, that a kind of field-mice increases wonderfully, so that in some places they did suddenly eat up whole fields of Corn. Inasmuch that many husbandmen appointing to reap their corn on the morrow, when they came with their reapers, found all their Corn wasted. And as these mice are generated suddenly, so they are suddenly consumed, in a few days, the reason whereof cannot be so well assigned. Pliny could not find how it should be, for neither could be they be found dead in the fields, neither alive within the earth in the winter time. 














## Animal Facts With Porta

The behavior of animals shows us hiddens sympathies and antipathies within nature.

Lots of ado about the inherent bitter rivalries found in nature:

- "A wild Bull being tied to a Fig tree, becomes tame and gentle, as Zoroaster says, who compiled a book called Geoponica, out of the choice writings of the Ancients."  Hence it was found out, that the stalks of wild Fig trees, if they are put to beef as it is boiling, makes it boil very quickly, as Pliny writes. "
- "Such a contrariety is there between the Elephant's Members , and that a kind of Leprosy which makes the skin of a man like the skin of an Elephant.  And they are a present remedy against that disease. "
- "The Ape of all other things cannot abide a Snail.  Now the Ape is a drunken beast.  For they are wont to take an Ape by making him drunk.  And a Snail well washed is a remedy against Drunkenness."
- Woman and snakes are such bitter enemies that even the smell of a snake will cause a miscarriage.
- "The Wolf  is afraid of the Urchin.  Thence, if we wash our mouth and throats with Urchin's blood, it will make our voice shrill, though before it were horse and dull like a Wolf's voice."
- "A Dog and a Wolf are at great enmity.  And therefore a Wolf skin put upon anyone that is bitten of a mad Dog, assuages the swelling of the Humor."
- "A Hawk is a deadly enemy to Pigeons, but they are defended by the Kastrel, which the Hawk cannot abide either to hear or see.  And this the Pigeons know well enough.  For wheresoever the Kastrel remains, there also will the Pigeons remain, thinking themselves safe because of their protector."
- "The Hart and the Serpent are at continual enmity. The Serpent as soon as he sees the Hart , gets him into his hole, but the Hart draws him out again with the breath of his nostrils and devours him. Hence it is that the fat and the blood of Harts, and the stones that grow in their eyes are ministered as fit remedies against the stinging and biting of the Serpent."
- "Likewise the breath of Elephants draws the Serpent out of their dens, and they fight with Dragons; and therefore the Members of Elephants, burned, drives away the Serpent."
- "The Lamprey fights with Serpents, and with her biting, kills the Basilisk, which is the most poisonous Serpent that is. So also the crowing of a Cock affrights the Basilisk, and he fights with Serpents to defend his Hens. The broth of the Cock is a good remedy against the Poison of Serpents."
- "A Swine eats up a Salamander, without danger, and is good against the Poison thereof."
- "The Hawk is an enemy to the Chameleon, and his Dung, drunk in Wine, is good against the Poison of the Chameleon. "
- "A Dog is most friendly to a man; and if you lay him to diseases part of your body, he takes away the disease to himself, as Pliny reports."

Many creatures are affected by the cycles of the moon:

- Shellfish get nutrition from the moon in much the same way plants get nutrition from the sun: "Living creatures are much at her beck, and receive from her great increase. For when she is at the full, as Lucilius says, she feeds Oysters, Crabs, shellfish, and such like, which her warm light does temper kindly in the night season; but when she is burns half or the quarter light, then she withdraws her nourishment, and they waste."
- "The Pismire, that little creature, has a sense of the change of the planets. For she works by night about the full of the Moon, but she rests all the space between the old and the new Moon. " (Pismires are ants)
- "The innards of Mice answer the Moon's proportion, for they increase with her, and with her they also shrink away."
- "The Beetle marks the ages and seasons of the planets. For he, gathering Dung out of the Mixen, rounds it up together, and covers it with Earth for eight and twenty days, hiding it so long as the Moon goes about the Zodiac, and when the new Moon comes, he opens that round ball of dirt, and then yields a young Beetle."
- "The beast Cynocephalus rejoices at the rising of the Moon, for then he stands up, lifting his fore-feet toward Heaven, and wears a Royal Ensign upon his head. And he has such a sympathy with the Moon, that when she meets with the Sun (as between the old and new Moon) so that she gives no light, the male, or he-Cynocephalus , never looks up, nor eats anything, as bewailing the loss of the Moon; and the female, as malcontent as he, all that while pisses blood."
- "Dogs are well acquainted with the rising of the Canicular star; for at that time they are commonly mad, and so are Vipers and Serpents, nay, then the very standing pools are moved, and the Wines work as they lie in the cellar, and other great and strange effects are wrought upon Earth. "

Animal instincts are a valuable source of scientific knowledge:

- "The beasts that have no reason, do by their nature strangely shun the eyes of Witches, and hurtful things."
- "The Doves, for a preservative against enchantments, first gather some little Bay tree boughs, and then lay them upon their nests, to preserve their young"
- "The Elephant having by chance eaten a Chameleon, against the Poison thereof, eats of the Wild Olive, whence Solinus, observes, that the same is a good remedy for men also in the same case. The Panthers, having swallowed up the poisonous Herb Aconitum, wherewith the hunters smear pieces of flesh to destroy them, against the Poisons thereof seek out man's Dung."
- "The Tortoise, having eaten a Serpent, dispels the Poison by eating the Herb Oregano."
- "Goats care not for Basil-gentle, because it brings a lethargy, as Chrysippus writes. The same beasts have also shown us what Herbs are good to cure wounds. "
- "The Elephant being wounded, seeks out the juice of Aloes, the thereby is cured. The same beasts have also found out purgations for themselves, and thereby taught us the same."
- "An Ass eats the Herb Asplnum to purge his Melancholy, of whom the Physicians have learned to minister the same Herb for the same purpose."
- "Dogs eat Grass to purge all their noisome Humors, which otherwise would make them mad. "
- "The Lion being sick of a Quatrain auge, eats and devours Ape, and so is healed. Therefore we know that Ape's blood is good against an Ague."
- "The griping of the belly and guts, is healed by looking upon Geese and Ducks, and Vegetius writes, and Cosumella says, that if a Duck does but look upon a sick Horse, she heals him. And Pliny says, that if you lay a Duck to the griping of ones belly, she takes away the disease, and dies of it herself, and Marcellus writes, that it is good for one that is so troubled, to eat the flesh of the Duck."
- "Elephants, against diseases of their eyes, drink Milk."
- "Serpents have caused Fennel to be very famous, for as soon as they taste of it, they become young again"
- "The Goats, when their eyes are bloodshot, let out the blood, the she-Goat by the point of a Bulrush, the he-Goat by the pricking of a thorn, which lets out the evil Humor, and yet never hurts the eye, but restores him his perfect sight. Hence, men learned by such means to cure the eyes."
- "Bear eyes are often dimmed, and for that cause they desire honeycomb above all things, that the Bees stinging their mouths, may thereby draw forth, together with the blood, that dull and gross Humor."
- "The Gullie-gut, when he is full of meat, he pitches himself between two trees, so to force out excrements."

Medicinal uses for animal parts:
- "A man's memory and wit is helped by a Hen's brain"
- "The heart of the Ape, takes away the palpitation of a man's heart, and increases boldness, which is seated in the heart. A Wolf's Yard boiled and minced, is good to eat for the procuring of lust, when strength begins to fail. The skin of a Ravens heel is good against Gout, the right-heel-skin must be laid on the right-foot, if that be gouty, and left upon the left. And finally, every member helps his like. But these things, Physicians write of, whole sayings it is not our purpose here to rehearse."
- "if you would make a woman fruitful, you must consider with your self the most fertile living creatures, and among the rest, an Hare, a Cony, or a Mouse; for an Hare is big even after she has brought forth, she genders every month, and brings not forth all her young all at once, but now and then one upon sundry days, and presently goes to Buck again, and so conceives while she gives suck, and carries in her womb at once, one young that is ripe, another that has no hair, and a third that is but lately conceived"
- "If you would have a man become bold or impudent, let him carry about him the skin or eyes of a Lion or a Cock, and he will be fearless of his enemies, nay, he will be very terrible unto them."
- "If you would have a man talkative, give him tongues, and seek out for him water Frogs, wild Geese and Ducks, and other such creatures, notorious for the continual noise-making, the tongues whereof, if you lay under the head or side of a woman as he is sleeping, because they are most clamorous in the evening, they will make her utter her night-secrecies."


- " If the Wolf sees us, his eyes make us dumb, the eyes of the Cockatrice and Basilisk will kill us forth-right, the Sea-lamprey stays the course of a ship, the Struthio-camelus can digest Iron. But none of these being dead, work ought, for when they perish, their Virtues also perish with them. Therefore it is a wise rule in natural Magick, that if a man will work any thing by living creatures, or by any of their parts or properties, he must take the benefit of them while they be alive, for if they die, their Virtue dies also."
- "the Wolf is hurtful and odious to Sheep after he is dead. For if you cover a drum with a Wolf's skin, the sound of it will make Sheep afraid, when most other creatures will not be afraid, nay, Sheep will make a heavy noise, whereas it contrariwise causes such clamorous creatures as hear it, to hold their peace. So if you cover it with a Bear skin, the sound thereof will make Horses run away. And if you make Harp-strings of all their guts severally, and put them together upon the instrument they will always jar, and never make comfort. The beast Hyena, and the Panther, are naturally at variance, therefore the skin of a dead Hyena makes the Panther run away, nay, if you hang their several skins one against the other, the Panther's skin will lose the hairs. So a Lions skin wastes and eats out the skins of other beasts, and so does the Wolf's skin eat up the Lamb's skin. Likewise, the feathers of other fowls, being put among Eagle feathers, do rot and consume of themselves. The beast Florus, and the bird Egithus are at such mortal enmity, that when they are dead, their blood cannot be mingled together'
- "Draw out a Frogs tongue, take away from the Ray or Fork-fish his Dart, the eyes or Stones out of any creatures head, or any such operative thing, not after they are dead, but while they are yet alive, and throw them into the water again, that if it be possible they may live still, left their Virtue should decay, but rather that by their living, they might quicken those their natural properties, and so you may work better thereby."

### Just the entirety of Book 2

In Book 2, we are told about how living creatures are spontaneously generated:


### Creating animal crossbreeds.

Nowadays, we understand that new creatures arise through mutation and selection. In this book, we learn that new creatures arise through the crossbreeding of existing ones. Any two species of animals can cross-breed as long as they meet the following requirements:

1. They must be the same size. "A Dog and a Wolf, a Lion and a Panther, an Ass and a Horse, a Partridge and a Hen, are of one bigness, and therefore may couple together, but a Horse and a Dog, or a Mare and an Elephant, or a Hen and a Sparrow cannot. "
2. They need to have similar gestational times, "For if one of them bring forth in twelve months, and the other in six, then the young will be ripe by one side, when it is but half ripe by the other." "So then a Dog cannot be born of a man, nor a Horse of an Elephant, because they differ in the time of their bearing."
3. They "must be one as lustful as the other." 

For example, dogs are really easy to cross with other animals, "suiting with many beasts, in bigness, in like time of breeding, and besides, being always ready for copulation, and very lecherous".

 - Mastiffs are a cross between dog and tiger, and refuse to fight unworthy opponents.
 - Arcadian dogs are likewise generated of a lion.
 - The Crocuta is a compound of the nature of dog and wolf. (But also the crocuta is the offspring of hyena and lioness?)
 - Greyhounds are suspected to be fox hybrids.
 - To get a dog that will do tricks, "you must first let them converse and company with an Ape, of whom they will learn many sportful tricks, and let them line the ape, and the young one which is born of them two, will be exceeding practiced to do feats, such as jugglers and players are wont to show by their Dogs."

> We will speak of the commixtion of Asses, Horses, and such like, though it be a known matter, yet it may be we shall add something which may delight the reader. Aelianus writes out of Democritus, that Mules are not nature's work, but a kind of theft and adultery devised by man, first committed by an Ass of Media, that by force covered a mare, and by chance got her with foal, which violence men learned of him, and after made a custom of it. Homer's Scholiast says, that Mules were first devised by the Venetians

- Mules, are a mixture of horse and ass, of course.
- Jumar are a cross between bull and ass, with two great knobs in stead of horns. They are supposed to be common in France, and Porta was dissapointed that he didn't get to see one.
- A leopard is gendered of a libard and a lioness. No, I don't know what a libard is.
- A thoes 




"Melitean dogs, which are such in the kind of Dogs, as dwarfs are among men." The author undestands that these are generated by deliberately selecting small dogs for breeding, but also reports that it comes from cramped living quarters and malnutrition.





But breeding is one of the oldest practically understood sciences. So is this just a consequence of poor infromation availibility?


> One that will make sport of himself, and leap up and down, and bark softly, and gnaw without biting, and stand upon his rear legs, holding forth his other legs like hands, and will fetch and carry, you must first let them converse and company with an Ape, of whom they will learn many sportful tricks, and let them line the ape, and the young one which is born of them two, will be exceeding practiced to do feats, such as jugglers and players are wont to show by their Dogs.  Albertus says, that these kind of Dogs may very well be generated of a Dog and a Fox.  

> If you would have them full of stout spirits, you must suffer them to suck the breasts of some other beasts, for always the milk, and the spirits of the nurse, are much available, both for the quality of the body, and the qualities of the soul. Oppianus bids us to keep hunting Dogs from sucking any ordinary bitches, or Goats, or Sheep, for this, says he, will make them too lazy and weak, but they must suck a tame Lioness, or Hart, or Doe, for so they will become swift and strong, like to their nurses that give them suck. And Aelianus gives us the very same precept, in the very same words, or , says he, then they shall remember that they had such strong swift nurses, nature will make them ashamed not to resemble their qualities. Pollux says, that for a while, the Dams milk is fittest meat for Whelps, but after, let them lap the blood of those beasts which Dogs have caught, that by little and little they may be acquainted with the sweetness of hunting. Ctefias in his book of Indian matters, writes, that the people called Cynamolgi, do nourish and feed many Dogs with Bulls blood, which afterward being let loose at the Bulls of India, overcome them and kill them, though they be never so fierce, and the people themselves milk their bitches, and drink it, as we drink Goats or Sheep milk, as Aelianus reports, and Solinus writes, that this is supposed to make that people flap-mouthed and to grin like Dogs. 


> for a Boar is exceeding hot is lust, and wonderfully desires coition, inasmuch, that if the female refuses to couple with him, either he will force her, or kill her. And surely howsoever, some wild beasts being made tame, are thereby unfit for generation as a Goose, a Hart brought up by hand from his birth, and a Boar is hardly fruitful in such a case. Yet there is no kind so apt for generation, the one being wild, and the other tame, as the kind of Swine is. And those which are thus gendered, these half-wilds, are called Hybrides, happily because there are generated in reproachful adultery. For hybris signifies reproach.  













Ah, so here
