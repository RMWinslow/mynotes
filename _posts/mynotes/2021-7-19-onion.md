We harvested a giant onion, over one meter in length. 
But I am worried it is a perennial, so I am trying to find out its cultivar.


One possiblity, looking pictures of onion cultivars, is [elephant garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_garlic). The flowers seem similar enough.
But [looking at additional pictures](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Allium_ampeloprasum_var._ampeloprasum), this cultivar has broad flat leaves. Ours was a singular hollow tube.
I guess that's good, since elephant garlic can't be seed propagated, according to wikipedia.



Yiru thinks that they are [Welsh bunching onions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_fistulosum). And that seems to be a good fit.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fu9CqbN74Q) on growing bunching onions says to grow clumps of seeds together.
Says they need phosporous and little else.



This video has maintainance guide for '[long white bunching onions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PasQKYUc2sQ)'.
