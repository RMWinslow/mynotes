Using various sources.

My goal tonight is to Figure out how distribution of secondary attack rate changes in response to various incentives.

Outline:

- [ ] Jot down some facts about negative binomial and gamma distributions based on *that one paper*
- [ ] For each of the following social assumptions, compute what needs to be done to induce the desired distribution of contacts
  - [ ] higher social capital means connections more productive
  - [ ] paramerterized utility that trades off between social and nonsocial activities
  - [ ] everyone has access to continuum of connections and
- [ ] For each of the above social setups and each of the below gov responses, calculate how distribution changes.
  - disease models
    - [ ] multiplying utility by a scaling factor dependent on how many connections you have. Eg penalty from disease is that you might die and stop expiriencing life. +
  - gov models
    - [ ] ignorance, no containment +
    - [ ] just letting everyone know + (above)
    - [ ] letting everyone know and they see the social connections of neighbors 
    - [ ] locking down random people +
    - [ ] locking down socialites
    - [ ] locking down people with higher chance of being sick but not necessarily the socialites
    - [ ] shutting down portion of connections for everyone +
    - [ ] imposing cost on connections +
    - [ ] imposing cost on connections above a certain threshold


Probably can't do all tonight, so goals tonight marked with +
